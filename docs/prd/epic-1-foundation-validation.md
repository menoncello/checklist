7. Example components demonstrate patterns

## Story 1.10: Pino Logging Infrastructure

**As a** developer,  
**I want** Pino logging integrated throughout the application with structured logging,  
**So that** we have production-ready logging with proper rotation, monitoring, and debugging capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Pino logger configured with default log levels (debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
2. Structured JSON output format for all log entries
3. Log rotation implemented using Pino native plugins (pino-roll) with configurable policies
4. File output configured using Pino file transport with separate files for different log levels
5. Support for 3rd party services via pino-transport plugins only (no custom implementations)
