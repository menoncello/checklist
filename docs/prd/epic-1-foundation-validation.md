# Epic 1: Foundation & Validation

**Goal:** Establish the technical foundation with Bun/TypeScript, validate the hybrid TUI approach early through a technology spike, implement core business logic, and create robust state management.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Structure

**As a** developer,  
**I want** a properly configured Bun/TypeScript project with modular architecture,  
**so that** the codebase is maintainable and supports both CLI and TUI interfaces.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Bun project initialized with TypeScript strict mode configuration
2. Monorepo structure created with `/packages/core`, `/packages/cli`, `/packages/tui` directories
3. ESLint and Prettier configured with consistent code style rules
4. Bun test runner configured with example test passing
5. Build script compiles TypeScript and runs without errors
6. Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore for Bun/Node projects
7. README.md created with basic project description and setup instructions
8. Performance budget defined: <50ms startup, <50MB memory, <20MB binary

## Story 1.2: TUI Technology Spike ⚠️ CRITICAL PATH

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to validate the hybrid TUI approach with a working prototype,  
**so that** we confirm technical feasibility before committing to full implementation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Spike implements three approaches: Ink, DIY hybrid, and pure ANSI
2. Each approach demonstrates: scrollable list, split-pane, keyboard input
3. Performance benchmarked: startup time, memory, render speed with 1000 items
4. Bun compatibility verified for all approaches
5. Decision matrix completed with scores for each approach
6. Fallback plan documented if primary approach fails
7. Terminal compatibility tested on macOS, Linux, Windows (WSL)
8. Go/No-Go decision documented with clear rationale
9. If No-Go: CLI-only alternative plan prepared

## Story 1.3: Core Workflow Engine ✨ NEW

**As a** developer,  
**I want** a pure business logic engine independent of any UI,  
**so that** the core functionality can be used by TUI, CLI, or future interfaces.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. WorkflowEngine class with no UI dependencies or console output
2. Engine loads workflow definitions and tracks current position
3. Methods: `getCurrentStep()`, `advance()`, `goBack()`, `skip()`, `reset()`
4. Event emitter pattern for state change notifications
5. Engine handles step conditions and branching logic
6. Full test coverage with unit tests only (no UI tests needed)
7. Engine can run headless for CI/CD environments
8. Performance: all operations complete in <10ms

## Story 1.4: State Management Implementation

**As a** developer,  
**I want** a robust YAML-based state management system,  
**so that** workflow progress persists between sessions and is human-readable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. State manager creates `.checklist/` directory structure automatically
2. YAML state files with schema: `state.yaml`, `config.yaml`, `history.yaml`
3. Atomic writes using temp file + rename strategy
4. Automatic backup before modifications in `.checklist/.backup/`
5. State corruption detection using checksums
6. JSON Schema validation ensures integrity
7. File locking prevents concurrent modification
8. Migration system for state file version updates
9. All operations complete in <50ms

## Story 1.5: Terminal Canvas System

**As a** developer,  
**I want** a custom terminal canvas abstraction,  
**so that** we have full control over TUI rendering.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. TerminalCanvas with double-buffering to prevent flicker
2. Terminal resize detection and handling
3. ANSI escape codes for cursor control and colors
4. Unicode box drawing with ASCII fallback
5. Text rendering with UTF-8 and emoji support
6. Render performance: 60fps with 1000 items
7. Memory usage <30MB during rendering
8. Terminal capability detection (color, unicode, size)

## Story 1.6: Component Base Architecture

**As a** developer,  
**I want** a reusable component system for TUI elements,  
**so that** UI elements are modular and maintainable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Abstract Component class with lifecycle methods
2. Focus management for keyboard navigation
3. Layout manager for split-pane and flexible layouts
4. Event system for component communication
5. Differential rendering (only redraw changes)
6. Component testing framework established
7. Example components demonstrate patterns
