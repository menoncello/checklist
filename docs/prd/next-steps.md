# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

Review the BMAD Checklist Manager PRD focusing on the TUI interface design. Create detailed wireframes for the split-pane layout, define the complete keybinding system following vim/lazygit patterns, and specify the visual design system including colors, typography, and status indicators. Pay special attention to the command differentiation UI and the workflow visualization components.

## Architect Prompt

Review the BMAD Checklist Manager PRD to create a comprehensive technical architecture document. Focus on the hybrid TUI implementation with custom components, the plugin-ready core engine design, state management with YAML, and the template security sandbox. Define the detailed module structure, API contracts between components, performance optimization strategies, and the build pipeline for multi-platform distribution using Bun's compilation features.
