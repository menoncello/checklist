# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

• Enable developers to maintain workflow context across multiple concurrent BMAD projects without productivity loss
• Transform static BMAD checklists into dynamic, interactive workflows with persistent local state management
• Reduce context switch time from 15-30 minutes to under 2 minutes when resuming work on projects
• Decrease workflow execution errors by 95% through clear command differentiation and step validation
• Achieve 90% workflow completion accuracy without referring to external documentation
• Establish a terminal-native workflow tool that integrates seamlessly with existing developer practices
• Create versionable, shareable workflow state that travels with code through Git
• Build foundation for community-driven template ecosystem to standardize BMAD best practices
• Provide robust state recovery mechanisms for corrupted or conflicted workflow data

## Background Context

The BMAD (Build, Measure, Adjust, Deploy) methodology has emerged as a structured approach for AI-assisted development, gaining rapid adoption as teams embrace AI coding assistants. However, practitioners face significant workflow management challenges when implementing it across multiple projects. Currently, developers lose 15-30 minutes per context switch, tracking their progress through fragmented tools including Claude Code chat history, scattered files, and manual notes. This fragmentation leads to increased error rates, cognitive overhead, and broken flow states—problems that compound as AI-assisted development accelerates.

Generic task management tools fail to address these needs because they treat checklists as static, linear lists rather than dynamic workflows with conditional branching and command differentiation. The BMAD Checklist Manager solves this by creating a terminal-native tool that stores workflow state alongside code in a `.checklist/` directory, transforming BMAD workflows from static documentation into interactive, stateful checklists that preserve context, prevent errors, and enable seamless project switching. With AI-assisted development becoming mainstream, proper workflow tooling is no longer optional—it's critical infrastructure for maintaining development velocity.
