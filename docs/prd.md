# BMAD Checklist Manager Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Enable developers to maintain workflow context across multiple concurrent BMAD projects without productivity loss
• Transform static BMAD checklists into dynamic, interactive workflows with persistent local state management
• Reduce context switch time from 15-30 minutes to under 2 minutes when resuming work on projects
• Decrease workflow execution errors by 95% through clear command differentiation and step validation
• Achieve 90% workflow completion accuracy without referring to external documentation
• Establish a terminal-native workflow tool that integrates seamlessly with existing developer practices
• Create versionable, shareable workflow state that travels with code through Git
• Build foundation for community-driven template ecosystem to standardize BMAD best practices
• Provide robust state recovery mechanisms for corrupted or conflicted workflow data

### Background Context

The BMAD (Build, Measure, Adjust, Deploy) methodology has emerged as a structured approach for AI-assisted development, gaining rapid adoption as teams embrace AI coding assistants. However, practitioners face significant workflow management challenges when implementing it across multiple projects. Currently, developers lose 15-30 minutes per context switch, tracking their progress through fragmented tools including Claude Code chat history, scattered files, and manual notes. This fragmentation leads to increased error rates, cognitive overhead, and broken flow states—problems that compound as AI-assisted development accelerates.

Generic task management tools fail to address these needs because they treat checklists as static, linear lists rather than dynamic workflows with conditional branching and command differentiation. The BMAD Checklist Manager solves this by creating a terminal-native tool that stores workflow state alongside code in a `.checklist/` directory, transforming BMAD workflows from static documentation into interactive, stateful checklists that preserve context, prevent errors, and enable seamless project switching. With AI-assisted development becoming mainstream, proper workflow tooling is no longer optional—it's critical infrastructure for maintaining development velocity.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The BMAD Checklist Manager embraces a **terminal-first philosophy** that treats context preservation as sacred. When switching between projects, the tool instantly restores your exact position in the workflow, including command history, variable state, and decision branches taken. The interface acts as an **intelligent co-pilot** rather than a task master—suggesting next steps, validating completions, and preventing common BMAD methodology errors. Every interaction is optimized for keyboard efficiency with zero mouse requirement, supporting both quick command execution and deep workflow exploration without breaking developer flow.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

• **Command-driven flow** with intuitive verbs (`init`, `next`, `done`, `status`, `back`, `skip`) that mirror natural workflow progression
• **Contextual awareness** through automatic state loading when entering project directories—zero manual project switching  
• **Smart command routing** with clear visual indicators: `[Claude]` for AI commands, `[$]` for terminal commands
• **Undo-friendly operations** allowing `checklist back` to reverse steps and `checklist reset` for complete restart
• **Selective disclosure** with `--verbose` flag for detailed output and `--quiet` for minimal distraction
• **Safe copy mechanisms** preventing accidental execution of Claude commands in terminal and vice versa

### Core CLI Outputs

• **Status Output** - Shows: current step (1/15), completion percentage, current command, time on step
• **List View** - Full workflow with checkmarks for completed, arrow for current, dimmed for upcoming
• **Detail Output** - Current step with full description, any warnings, command with variables resolved
• **Project Summary** - All active projects with their current states when run from parent directory
• **History View** - Recently completed steps with timestamps and any notes captured
• **Diff View** - What changed in workflow template vs current state (for template updates)
• **Help Output** - Context-sensitive help showing only relevant commands for current state

### Accessibility: Clean Terminal Output

Clean terminal output compatible with screen readers, `--no-color` mode for monochrome displays or pipes, `--ascii` mode for environments without UTF-8 support. All status information available via exit codes for scripting integration.

### Branding

Friendly but professional tone using developer-familiar language. Celebratory messages for milestone completions ("🎉 Epic completed!"). Empathetic error messages ("Oops, that step needs to be completed first. Run `checklist status` to see requirements."). Optional fun mode with ASCII art progress bars and achievement unlocks.

### Target Device and Platforms: Terminal-Native Cross-Platform

Runs in any POSIX-compliant shell (bash, zsh, fish) on macOS, Linux, Windows (Git Bash, WSL, PowerShell 7+). Requires terminal with minimum 80-character width, supports 256 colors (graceful degradation to 16 or monochrome), UTF-8 encoding preferred (ASCII fallback available).

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo with Clear Module Separation

Single repository organized with clear module boundaries: `/packages/core` (business logic), `/packages/cli` (CLI interface), `/packages/tui` (TUI implementation), `/templates` (built-in BMAD templates), `/docs` (user and developer documentation), `/examples` (sample projects for testing). This structure supports both `bun install` workflow and future plugin architecture while maintaining clear separation of concerns.

### Service Architecture

**Standalone CLI with Progressive Enhancement** - Core distributed as single Bun-compiled binary with embedded templates. Architecture supports future additions via feature flags (`--tui` mode default, `--no-tui` for automation), optional shell integration scripts, and potential daemon mode for filesystem watching. All state operations use transactional writes with atomic file operations to prevent corruption. Configuration cascade: command flags → environment variables → project `.checklist/config.yaml` → user `~/.config/checklist/` → embedded defaults.

### Testing Requirements

**Pragmatic Testing Pyramid:**
- **Unit tests (80% coverage):** Core state management, template parsing, workflow engine logic
- **Integration tests:** CLI commands, filesystem operations, clipboard integration  
- **Workflow tests:** Complete BMAD scenarios using example projects in `/examples/`
- **Compatibility tests:** Automated testing on macOS, Linux, Windows via GitHub Actions
- **Template validation tests:** Ensuring all bundled templates parse and execute correctly
- **Performance tests:** Benchmarking response times stay under 100ms threshold
- **Manual testing playbooks:** Step-by-step guides for testing complex scenarios

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

• **Runtime:** Bun as high-performance JavaScript/TypeScript runtime
• **Language:** TypeScript with strict configuration for type safety
• **State Management:** YAML format with JSON Schema validation, automatic backup before modifications
• **Template Engine:** Custom engine supporting variables, conditionals, loops with sandboxed execution
• **TUI Framework:** Hybrid approach - custom components with minimal auxiliary libraries
• **File Operations:** Bun's native file APIs for optimal I/O performance
• **Process Management:** Bun.spawn() for command execution
• **Shell Integration:** Bun Shell for safe command execution
• **Build System:** `bun build --compile` for standalone binaries
• **Distribution:** Binaries via GitHub Releases, npm package with bunx support, Homebrew formula
• **Performance Targets:** <50ms startup, <50MB memory, <20MB binary size
• **Security:** No telemetry, local-only data, respect .gitignore, sandboxed template execution
• **Backward Compatibility:** State files readable across minor versions, migration for major versions
• **Concurrent Access:** File locking to prevent simultaneous state modifications
• **IDE Preparation:** Core engine designed to support future VSCode/IntelliJ plugins
