## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 2.1 established the CLI core interface using Bun.argv for command parsing. The CLI infrastructure is complete and working. This story (2.2) shifts focus to TUI components, specifically the detail panel that will display checklist step details.

### Data Models

**Step Data Structure** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Step]:

```typescript
interface Step {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string; // This will contain markdown to render
  type: 'task' | 'confirmation' | 'input' | 'automated' | 'multi-command';
  commands: Command[]; // These need Claude/Bash indicators
}

interface Command {
  id: string;
  type: 'claude' | 'bash' | 'internal'; // Determines indicator type
  content: string;
}
```

### API Specifications

No REST API endpoints required for this story - pure TUI component functionality.

### Component Specifications

**TUI Framework Context** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#TUI/CLI Framework]:

- Custom ANSI Terminal UI rendering (v1.0.0) for full control
- Custom ViewSystem (v1.0.0) for screen management
- Custom Components (v1.0.0) for consistent layout patterns
- Custom Canvas (v1.0.0) for low-level terminal rendering
- Custom EventBus (v1.0.0) for keyboard/UI event processing

**Component Architecture** [Source: architecture/components.md]:

- TUI Renderer (#6) handles all terminal UI rendering
- View System (#7) manages screens and navigation
- Terminal Canvas (#8) provides low-level rendering

**Existing TUI Infrastructure** [Source: story-1.9-component-architecture.md]:

- ViewSystem already implemented with navigation stack
- BaseComponent system available for extending
- Layout management supports split-pane views
- Performance monitoring integrated (<50ms requirement)

### File Locations

Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:

- **Component Location**: `packages/tui/src/components/DetailPanel.ts`
- **Markdown Renderer**: `packages/tui/src/components/MarkdownRenderer.ts` (align with existing component structure)
- **Tests Location**: `packages/tui/tests/components/DetailPanel.test.ts`
- **Integration with**: Existing ViewSystem at `packages/tui/src/views/ViewSystem.ts`

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- **Framework**: Bun test runner (built-in)
- **Test Location**: `packages/tui/tests/components/`
- **Coverage Target**: >85% for TUI components
- **Performance Tests**: Use Tinybench for <50ms validation
- **Visual Testing**: Use snapshot testing for markdown rendering output

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:

- ESLint rules must pass - no `any` types allowed
- Maximum 80 character line width (Prettier)
- Use Pino logger from `@checklist/core/utils/logger`
- Follow import ordering: builtin → external → internal
- No console.log - use debug logger instead

**Performance Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Performance Testing]:

- Panel update time: <50ms
- Memory usage: Stay within baseline limits
- Use PerformanceMonitor from Story 1.8 for metrics

**Terminal Compatibility** [Source: story-1.8 Terminal Canvas]:

- Must support: Terminal.app, iTerm2, Alacritty, Windows Terminal
- Graceful degradation for limited terminals
- Terminal capability detection handled by existing Canvas implementation

### Project Structure Notes

The TUI package structure is properly set up at `packages/tui/src/` with:

- Existing component infrastructure in `components/`
- View system in `views/`
- Event handling in `events/`
- Performance monitoring in `performance/`

No DetailPanel or markdown-related components exist yet - this story will create them.

### Implementation Specifics

**Markdown Parsing Approach**:

- Custom lightweight markdown parser implementation (no external markdown library needed)
- Parse only required elements: bold, italic, code blocks, links, headers
- Use ansis package (already in dependencies) for ANSI color codes

**Component Integration**:

- DetailPanel extends BaseComponent for lifecycle management
- Use existing ScrollableContainer for content scrolling
- Integrate with ComponentRegistry for proper registration
- Leverage existing PerformanceMonitor for tracking render times

**Variable Pattern Specifications**:

- Template variables: `{{variableName}}` - for user-defined template vars
- Environment variables: `$ENV_VAR` or `${ENV_VAR}` - for shell/system vars
- Use regex patterns: `/\{\{(\w+)\}\}/g`, `/\$\{?(\w+)\}?/g`

**Clipboard Implementation**:

- Move clipboardy from devDependencies to dependencies
- Implement try-catch for clipboard operations
- Provide fallback UI for manual copying if clipboard fails

**Priority Languages for Syntax Highlighting**:

1. bash/shell - for command blocks
2. typescript - for code examples
3. yaml - for configuration
4. json - for data structures
5. markdown - for nested markdown examples

## Testing

### Test File Location

`packages/tui/tests/components/DetailPanel.test.ts`
`packages/tui/tests/components/MarkdownRenderer.test.ts`

### Test Standards

- Use Bun test runner with native testing capabilities
- Coverage target: >85% for DetailPanel component
- Include unit tests for markdown parsing
- Include integration tests with ViewSystem
- Add visual regression tests using snapshot testing
- Performance tests using Tinybench for <50ms validation

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns

- Unit Testing: Bun Test (built-in)
- Snapshot Testing: Bun Test Snapshots (built-in)
- Performance Testing: Tinybench (already in devDependencies)

### Specific Testing Requirements for This Story

1. Test all markdown formatting elements (bold, italic, code blocks)
2. Verify command type detection and indicator display
3. Test variable highlighting patterns
4. Validate scrolling behavior with different content sizes
5. Test copy functionality with clipboardy integration
6. Performance benchmark: panel updates must be <50ms
7. Test terminal compatibility across different emulators
