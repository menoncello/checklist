## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.4 (Performance Monitoring System):
- Performance monitoring infrastructure is established in `packages/tui/src/performance/`
- Debug overlay system is available for development
- Startup profiler can be used to measure compatibility detection overhead
- Performance requirements: <50ms response time, <50MB memory baseline

### Terminal System Architecture

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#terminal]
The terminal compatibility system should be implemented in `packages/tui/src/terminal/`:

- CapabilityDetector.ts - Terminal feature detection
- TerminalInfo.ts - Terminal metadata and capabilities
- FallbackRenderer.ts - Graceful degradation rendering
- ColorSupport.ts - Color capability management

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tui-framework]

- supports-color 9.4.x for terminal capability detection
- Custom ANSI 1.0.0 for terminal rendering
- Custom Canvas 1.0.0 for low-level terminal operations
- Performance Monitor 1.0.0 for tracking rendering performance

### Integration Points

[Source: architecture/components.md#tui-components]

#### Core Component Integration

**TerminalCanvas Integration:**
- CapabilityDetector provides capability profile to TerminalCanvas
- TerminalCanvas adapts rendering based on detected capabilities
- FallbackRenderer integrates with Canvas for degraded output
- ColorSupport provides safe color palettes for Canvas rendering

**EventManager Integration:**
- EventManager receives capability limitations from CapabilityDetector
- Input handlers filter events based on terminal capabilities
- Mouse events are conditionally enabled based on detection results
- Keyboard shortcuts adapt based on available terminal features

**PerformanceMonitor Integration:**
- Compatibility detection metrics reported to PerformanceMonitor
- Rendering performance tracked by capability level
- Memory usage monitored for compatibility system components
- Performance alerts triggered for capability detection delays

**ViewSystem Integration:**
- View components receive capability information for adaptive rendering
- Layout managers adjust based on terminal size constraints
- Screen components implement fallback rendering strategies
- Navigation systems adapt to available input methods

#### Application Lifecycle Integration

**Startup Sequence:**
1. CapabilityDetector runs during TUI initialization
2. Results stored in TerminalInfo for component access
3. FallbackRenderer configured based on capabilities
4. All components initialized with capability awareness

**Runtime Adaptation:**
- Terminal resize events trigger capability re-validation
- Capability changes propagate to all components
- Fallback modes activated/deactivated dynamically
- User preferences updated based on capabilities

**Error Recovery Integration:**
- ErrorBoundary receives capability-aware error handlers
- CrashRecovery includes terminal state restoration
- StatePreservation accounts for capability limitations
- Recovery actions adapt to available terminal features

#### Testing and Debug Integration

**DebugRenderer Integration:**
- Debug overlay shows current terminal capabilities
- Performance metrics include capability detection timing
- Capability change events logged for debugging
- Development mode provides capability simulation

**Testing Framework Integration:**
- Test fixtures include capability matrix variations
- Visual regression tests cover all capability levels
- Performance tests validate detection overhead targets
- Integration tests verify component compatibility adaptation

### Performance Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#performance]

- Startup time: <100ms (compatibility detection must be fast)
- Memory baseline: <50MB (capability detection should be lightweight)
- Command response: <50ms (terminal operations must remain responsive)
- Compatibility detection overhead: <5ms

#### Compatibility Detection Performance Targets

**Capability Detection Timing Requirements:**
- **Terminal type identification**: <1ms (cached results, single query)
- **Color support detection**: <2ms (supports-color library + validation)
- **Unicode support detection**: <1ms (simple character set test)
- **Mouse support detection**: <1ms (terminal query with timeout)
- **Size detection**: <0.5ms (immediate terminal API call)
- **Total detection overhead**: <5ms (all capabilities combined)

**Memory Usage Targets:**
- **CapabilityDetector instance**: <100KB memory footprint
- **TerminalInfo cache**: <50KB per terminal type
- **FallbackRenderer overhead**: <25KB additional memory
- **Detection result caching**: 1MB maximum cache size

#### Performance Monitoring Integration

[Source: Story 2.4 Performance Monitoring System]

- Integrate with existing PerformanceMonitor for capability detection metrics
- Use StartupProfiler to measure initialization overhead
- Implement memory tracking for compatibility system components
- Create performance alerts when detection exceeds 5ms threshold
- Log capability detection success rates and timing distributions

### Security Considerations

[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#terminal-security]

Terminal compatibility detection must implement secure handling practices:

#### Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Terminal environment variables**: Validate and sanitize `TERM`, `COLORTERM`, `TERM_PROGRAM` before use
- **Capability queries**: Escape and validate all terminal control sequences before execution
- **Size detection**: Validate terminal dimensions to prevent integer overflow or buffer issues
- **Input buffer protection**: Implement bounds checking for all terminal input processing

#### Capability Detection Security
- **Safe fallback**: Always default to known-safe capabilities when detection fails
- **Rate limiting**: Limit capability detection queries to prevent terminal flooding
- **Timeout handling**: Implement timeouts for all terminal capability queries
- **Malformed sequence protection**: Reject malformed ANSI sequences with detailed logging

#### Terminal Input Security
- **Mouse input validation**: Sanitize mouse coordinate data before processing
- **Keyboard input filtering**: Validate all keyboard events against capability profile
- **Clipboard access**: Implement secure clipboard integration with user confirmation
- **File path handling**: Sanitize all file paths in terminal-related operations

### Error Handling Strategy

[Source: architecture/error-handling.md#error-categories]

#### Terminal Compatibility Error Recovery Patterns

**User Errors (Clear Recovery Guidance):**
- **Terminal too small**: Show exact required dimensions and resize command
- **Insufficient capabilities**: List missing features and suggest terminal upgrades
- **Encoding issues**: Provide UTF-8 setup instructions and locale configuration
- **Permission errors**: Guide users through terminal permission settings

**System Errors (Graceful Degradation):**
- **Capability detection failure**: Default to ASCII mode with clear notification
- **Terminal reset recovery**: Implement automatic terminal state restoration
- **Resource exhaustion**: Implement memory cleanup and capability reduction
- **Input handling errors**: Fallback to keyboard-only navigation

**Development Errors (Detailed Debugging):**
- **Detection timing issues**: Log capability detection duration and success rates
- **Rendering failures**: Capture terminal state before and after rendering errors
- **Integration failures**: Document component interaction points and failure modes
- **Performance anomalies**: Track capability detection overhead and alert on thresholds

#### Error Recovery Hierarchy
1. **Immediate recovery**: Fallback to ASCII rendering (always available)
2. **Progressive recovery**: Reduce capabilities until stable operation achieved
3. **User-guided recovery**: Provide actionable error messages and solutions
4. **Safe shutdown**: Graceful exit with state preservation when recovery impossible

### Code Quality Standards
