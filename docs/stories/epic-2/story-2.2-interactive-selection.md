# Story 2.2: Interactive Selection System

## Overview

Build an interactive menu selection system that allows users to navigate and interact with checklist items using keyboard controls, adaptable to either CLI or TUI based on the spike decision.

## Story Details

- **Epic**: 2 - User Interface & Interaction
- **Type**: Feature
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 2 days
- **Dependencies**: [2.1, 1.2-decision]

## Description

Create a robust selection system that provides intuitive navigation through checklist items, supporting multiple selection modes and keyboard shortcuts. The implementation will adapt based on whether we're using CLI (enquirer-style) or TUI (Ink/Blessed) approach.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Navigate checklist items with arrow keys (↑/↓)
- [ ] Multi-select capability with spacebar
- [ ] Single-select with enter key
- [ ] Filter/search items by typing (fuzzy search)
- [ ] Vim keybindings support:
  - `j/k` for down/up navigation
  - `g/G` for top/bottom
  - `/` for search mode
  - `x` for toggle selection
- [ ] Visual feedback for:
  - Current selection (highlighted)
  - Selected items (checkbox indicator)
  - Disabled/blocked items (dimmed)
- [ ] Smooth scrolling for long lists
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation for nested checklists
- [ ] Escape key to go back/cancel

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture

```typescript
interface SelectionSystem {
  items: SelectableItem[];
  currentIndex: number;
  selectedIndices: Set<number>;

  // Navigation
  moveUp(): void;
  moveDown(): void;
  moveToTop(): void;
  moveToBottom(): void;

  // Selection
  toggleSelection(): void;
  selectAll(): void;
  clearSelection(): void;

  // Filtering
  setFilter(query: string): void;
  clearFilter(): void;

  // Rendering
  render(): string | ReactElement;
}

interface SelectableItem {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  description?: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'active' | 'completed' | 'blocked';
  selectable: boolean;
  children?: SelectableItem[];
}
```

### Implementation Approaches

#### CLI Mode (Fallback)

- Use ANSI escape sequences for cursor control
- Implement custom readline interface
- Manual screen buffer management

#### TUI Mode (If spike succeeds)

- Use framework's built-in list components
- Leverage framework's event system
- Native scrolling and rendering

### Performance Requirements

- List rendering <50ms for 1000 items
- Keystroke response <16ms (60fps)
- Smooth scrolling without flicker
- Memory usage <10MB for large lists

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for selection logic
- [ ] Integration tests for keyboard handling
- [ ] Visual regression tests for rendering
- [ ] Performance tests with large datasets
- [ ] Accessibility testing (screen reader compatibility)
- [ ] Cross-platform terminal testing

## Edge Cases to Handle

- Empty list states
- Single item lists
- Very long item labels
- Deeply nested structures (>5 levels)
- Terminal resize during interaction
- Rapid key inputs (debouncing)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All navigation methods working smoothly
- [ ] Selection state properly managed
- [ ] Visual feedback clear and responsive
- [ ] Vim keybindings implemented
- [ ] Search/filter functioning
- [ ] Tests passing with >85% coverage
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Works in both CLI and TUI modes
