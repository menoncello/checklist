# Epic 2: TUI Core with Performance

## Status: 🚧 IN PROGRESS (42.9% Complete - 3/7 stories)

## Goal

Build the complete TUI interface with core checklist functionality, ensuring high performance and terminal compatibility from the start.

## Success Criteria

- ✅ TUI renders checklists with smooth scrolling
- ✅ Virtual scrolling handles 10,000+ items
- ✅ All operations maintain <100ms response time
- ✅ Keyboard navigation fully functional
- ✅ Works across major terminal emulators

## Stories (7 total, 3 complete)

### ✅ Completed
1. [Story 2.1: CLI Core Interface](story-2.1-cli-core-interface.md) ✅ **COMPLETE**
2. [Story 2.2: Interactive Selection System](story-2.2-interactive-selection.md) ✅ **COMPLETE**
3. [Story 2.5: TUI Application Shell](../2.5.story.md) ✅ **COMPLETE**

### 📝 Ready to Start

## Dependencies

- Epic 1 must be substantially complete (currently 100%) ✅ **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Story 1.4 (TUI Spike) **PASSED** - Proceeding with TUI implementation
- Core infrastructure from Epic 1 is ready (state, workflow, logging, DI)

## Risk Factors

- 🟡 Performance with large lists (addressed by virtual scrolling)
- 🟡 Terminal compatibility issues (dedicated story 2.6)
- 🟡 Flicker on slower systems (performance monitoring in place)
- 🟢 TUI spike passed - major risk mitigated

## Timeline Estimate

**2 weeks** (can begin while Epic 1 completes)
