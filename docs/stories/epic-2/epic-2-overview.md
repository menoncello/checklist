# Epic 2: TUI Core with Performance

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE (100% - 6/6 stories)

## Goal

Build the complete TUI interface with core checklist functionality, ensuring high performance and terminal compatibility from the start.

## Success Criteria

- âœ… TUI renders checklists with smooth scrolling
- âœ… Virtual scrolling handles 10,000+ items
- âœ… All operations maintain <100ms response time
- âœ… Keyboard navigation fully functional
- âœ… Works across major terminal emulators

## Stories (6 total, 6 complete)

## Dependencies

- âœ… Story 1.4 (TUI Spike) **PASSED** - Proceeding with TUI implementation
- Core infrastructure from Epic 1 is ready (state, workflow, logging, DI)

## Risk Factors

- ðŸŸ¡ Performance with large lists (addressed by virtual scrolling)
- ðŸŸ¡ Terminal compatibility issues (dedicated story 2.6)
- ðŸŸ¡ Flicker on slower systems (performance monitoring in place)
- ðŸŸ¢ TUI spike passed - major risk mitigated

## Timeline Estimate

**2 weeks** (can begin while Epic 1 completes)
