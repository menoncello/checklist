# Story 1.12: StrykerJS Mutation Testing Infrastructure

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** StrykerJS configured for mutation testing with Bun integration,  
**So that** we have high-quality test coverage validation and can identify weak test assertions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. StrykerJS configured with command runner to execute Bun tests directly
2. Mutation score threshold set to 85% minimum
3. StrykerJS integrated into CI/CD pipeline with failure on threshold breach
4. All default mutators enabled for comprehensive mutation coverage
5. HTML reporter configured for visual mutation reports
6. Incremental testing enabled for faster PR validation
7. Dashboard integration for tracking mutation score trends
8. Parallel execution configured for optimal performance

## Testing

### Test Strategy
- **Mutation Testing**: Achieve 85% minimum mutation score across all modules
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure mutation testing completes within CI timeout
- **Integration Testing**: Verify StrykerJS works correctly with Bun test runner
- **Report Validation**: Confirm HTML and JSON reports are generated correctly

### StrykerJS Configuration for Bun

**Correct Configuration for Bun Support:**

```javascript
// stryker.conf.js
module.exports = {
  packageManager: 'npm',  // Required for StrykerJS
  testRunner: 'command',   // Use command runner for Bun
  commandRunner: {
    command: 'bun test --bail --coverage'  // Execute Bun directly
  },
  mutate: ['packages/*/src/**/*.ts', '!**/*.test.ts', '!**/*.spec.ts'],
  thresholds: { high: 95, low: 90, break: 85 },
  reporters: ['html', 'json', 'progress', 'dashboard'],
  htmlReporter: {
    fileName: 'reports/mutation/index.html'
  },
  incremental: true,
  incrementalFile: '.stryker-tmp/incremental.json',
  concurrency: 4,
  timeoutMS: 60000,
  disableTypeChecks: false
};
```

### Package.json Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "bun test",
    "test:mutation": "bunx stryker run",
    "test:mutation:incremental": "bunx stryker run --incremental"
  }
}
```

### Validation Steps
1. Run mutation tests locally: `bunx stryker run`
2. Verify HTML report: Open `reports/mutation/index.html`
3. Check mutation score meets 85% threshold
4. Validate incremental mode: `bunx stryker run --incremental`
5. Test CI integration: Push changes and verify GitHub Actions

└── packages/                      # Monorepo packages to test
    ├── core/
    ├── cli/
    └── tui/
```

**Testing Infrastructure** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy-complete-with-all-testing-utilities.md#mutation-testing-strategy]:
- StrykerJS version 9.1.x (latest stable version - supersedes architecture doc 8.2.x)
- Command runner configuration for Bun compatibility
- Mutation score threshold: 85% minimum (break), 90% low, 95% high
- Reports output to `reports/mutation/` directory as per source tree structure
- Incremental testing file stored in `.stryker-tmp/incremental.json`
- Dashboard token stored as GitHub Secret: `STRYKER_DASHBOARD_API_TOKEN`

**Tech Stack Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#testing-suite]:
- StrykerJS 9.1.x for mutation testing (latest stable - supersedes tech-stack.md 8.2.x)
- Bun Test (built-in) for unit and integration tests
- Bun Coverage (built-in) for coverage reporting
- npm audit (built-in) for security scanning dependencies

**Security Configuration**:
- Dashboard API token: Store in GitHub Secrets as `STRYKER_DASHBOARD_API_TOKEN`
- Access in CI: `${{ secrets.STRYKER_DASHBOARD_API_TOKEN }}`
- Local development: Use `.env.local` (gitignored) with `STRYKER_DASHBOARD_API_TOKEN=your-token`

**Project Structure Alignment** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#project-structure]:
- Configuration file: `stryker.conf.js` in project root
- Reports directory: `reports/mutation/` for HTML reports
- Temporary files: `.stryker-tmp/` for incremental testing cache
- Test files location: `packages/*/tests/` following monorepo structure

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#eslint-configuration-rules]:
- Follow ESLint rules for TypeScript code quality
- No console.log - use Pino logger instead
- Mandatory security rules: no-eval, no-unsafe-regex
- Import organization must follow defined groups

### Bun Compatibility for StrykerJS

**Issue:** StrykerJS does not natively support Bun as a test runner or package manager.

**Solution:** Use command runner to execute Bun tests:
1. Use `bunx` to execute StrykerJS directly without installing globally
2. Configure command runner to execute `bun test`
3. This allows StrykerJS to mutate code while using Bun for test execution

### CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions Workflow Structure:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  mutation-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      - run: bun install
      
      # Cache for faster builds
      - uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: |
            ~/.bun/install/cache
            .stryker-tmp
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-bun-stryker-${{ hashFiles('**/bun.lockb') }}
      
      # Run mutation testing
      - name: Mutation Testing
        env:
          STRYKER_DASHBOARD_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.STRYKER_DASHBOARD_API_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          if [ "${{ github.event_name }}" = "pull_request" ]; then
            bunx stryker run --incremental
          else
            bunx stryker run --reporters dashboard,html,json
          fi
      
      # Upload reports
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          name: mutation-report
          path: reports/mutation/
```

### Mutation Testing Goals by Module

| Module | Target Score | Priority | Notes |
|--------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Workflow Engine | 95% | P0 | Critical business logic |
| Core Utils | 90% | P0 | Foundation utilities |
| State Management | 85% | P1 | Complex state handling |
| CLI Commands | 85% | P1 | User-facing functionality |
| TUI Components | 80% | P2 | Visual components |
| Test Utilities | 75% | P3 | Testing infrastructure |

### Performance Considerations
- Mutation testing is CPU-intensive
- Configure concurrency based on available cores
- Use incremental mode for PR validation
- Full mutation testing only on main branch merges
- Consider using `--since` flag for changed files only

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Timeout Errors**:
   - Increase `timeoutMS` in configuration
   - Reduce concurrency if memory-constrained
   - Use `--logLevel debug` for diagnostics

2. **False Positives**:
   - Some mutants may be equivalent (no behavioral change)
   - Document known equivalent mutants
   - Use `// Stryker disable` comments sparingly

3. **Performance Issues**:
   - Use incremental mode for local development
   - Configure file filters to exclude generated code
   - Optimize test suite for faster execution
