## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 2.3 successfully implemented Core Navigation Commands with comprehensive event handling, command queueing, and visual feedback. The EventBus, ViewSystem, and PerformanceMonitor integration is established and working properly. Key technical patterns established:

- BaseComponent extension for lifecycle management
- EventBus integration for event processing
- Performance monitoring with <50ms validation
- Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
- Command queueing for race condition prevention

### Data Models

**Application State** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#ChecklistTemplate]:

```typescript
interface ApplicationState {
  version: string;
  mode: 'tui' | 'cli';
  activeWorkflow?: WorkflowState;
  terminal: TerminalInfo;
  layout: LayoutState;
  focus: FocusState;
  errorState?: ErrorState;
}

interface LayoutState {
  type: 'split-pane';
  ratio: number; // 0.0 to 1.0
  leftPanel: PanelState;
  rightPanel: PanelState;
}

interface FocusState {
  activePanel: 'left' | 'right';
  focusedComponent?: string;
}

interface TerminalInfo {
  supportsColor: boolean;
  supportsUnicode: boolean;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  originalMode?: number;
}
```

**Component Lifecycle** [Source: architecture/components.md#Component Initialization Order]:

The Application Shell should follow the established initialization order:

1. Load Config → State Manager → Recovery Manager → State Validation
2. Template Manager → Security Sandbox → Variable Manager → Workflow Engine
3. Command Executor → Performance Monitor → Plugin System
4. TUI Renderer (including Application Shell components)

### API Specifications

- Maximum 80 character line width (Prettier)
- Use Pino logger from `@checklist/core/utils/logger`
- Follow import ordering: builtin → external → internal
- No console.log - use debug logger instead

**Performance Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Performance Testing]:

- Startup time: <100ms for version splash and initialization
- Layout reflow: <50ms during resize operations
- Memory usage: Stay within baseline limits
- Use PerformanceMonitor from Story 1.8 for metrics tracking
- Event loop must not block during layout operations

**Resource Management Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Resource Management Standards]:

- Implement Disposable pattern for all resources
- Clear timers and intervals in cleanup methods
- Use WeakMap/WeakSet for object metadata
- Proper signal handling for terminal management

**TUI Rendering Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#TUI Rendering Standards]:

- Use differential rendering for performance

### Project Structure Notes

The TUI package structure supports application shell components at `packages/tui/src/` with:

- Application framework at `framework/` (UIFramework.ts, ApplicationLoop.ts, Lifecycle.ts)
- Layout management at `layout/` (LayoutManager.ts, header/footer components)
- Event handling system at `events/` (EventManager.ts, KeyboardHandler.ts)
- Error handling at `errors/` (ErrorBoundary.ts, CrashRecovery.ts)
- Performance monitoring at `performance/` (PerformanceMonitor.ts)
- Terminal management at `terminal/` (CapabilityDetector.ts, TerminalInfo.ts)

Application shell components will integrate into this existing infrastructure without structural conflicts.

### Implementation Specifics

**Application Shell Architecture**:

- ApplicationShell extends existing UIFramework patterns
- Integrates with ApplicationLoop for main event processing
- Uses Lifecycle interface for proper startup/shutdown sequencing
- Coordinates all TUI subsystems through dependency injection

**Terminal Management Pattern**:

- TerminalManager handles raw mode setup/teardown
- Preserves and restores original terminal state
- Integrates with CapabilityDetector for feature detection
- Uses FallbackRenderer for limited terminal support

**Layout Management Integration**:

- SplitPaneLayout extends BaseComponent for lifecycle management
- Integrates with existing LayoutManager for consistency
- Uses established resize handling patterns
- Maintains focus state integration with InputRouter

**Input Router Architecture**:

- InputRouter coordinates between KeyboardHandler and components
- Implements focus management with keyboard navigation
- Routes events based on current focus state
- Integrates with existing EventBus for event propagation

**Error Recovery Implementation**:

- ErrorBoundary wraps entire application for crash prevention
- PanicRecovery provides safe fallback modes
- StatePreservation ensures data integrity during errors
- Error reporting includes context for debugging

**Shutdown Management**:

- ShutdownManager coordinates graceful exit sequence
- State saving integrates with existing State Manager
- Resource cleanup follows Disposable pattern
- Signal handling ensures proper response to termination

**Security Considerations**:

- Terminal mode changes require proper validation
- Input sanitization for all keyboard events
- State lock validation during layout operations
- Safe fallback modes prevent data corruption
