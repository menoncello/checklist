## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree

Based on project structure in `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`:
- Place ViewSystem in `packages/tui/src/views/`
- Core view components in `packages/tui/src/views/components/`
- Layout management in `packages/tui/src/layout/`
- Navigation stack in `packages/tui/src/navigation/`

### Architecture Context

From `docs/architecture/components.md`, the component architecture shows:
- TUI Renderer is component #6 in initialization order
- ViewSystem will integrate with existing TUI Renderer
- Must work with State Manager (#2) for view state persistence
- Integrates with Performance Monitor (#8) for view switching metrics

### Dependencies Integration

**Story 1.5 (State Management)**: ViewSystem will use existing state management for:
- Persisting view state between sessions
- Managing navigation history
- Storing user preferences for layouts

**Story 1.8 (Terminal Canvas)**: ViewSystem will leverage terminal canvas for:
- Rendering view components
- Managing screen updates
- Handling terminal capabilities

**Story 1.13 (IoC Container)**: ViewSystem will be registered in dependency container for:
- Service injection
- Lifecycle management
- Cross-component communication

### Technical Implementation Details

#### ViewSystem Interface
```typescript
interface ViewSystem {
  // View Management
  registerView(id: string, view: View): void;
  navigateTo(viewId: string, params?: any): void;
  goBack(): void;
  canGoBack(): boolean;

  // Layout Management
  setLayout(layout: LayoutType): void;
  splitView(primary: string, secondary: string): void;

  // State Management
  saveViewState(viewId: string): void;
  restoreViewState(viewId: string): void;

  // Modal/Overlay
  showModal(modal: Modal): Promise<any>;
  showOverlay(overlay: Overlay): void;
  hideOverlay(): void;
}
```

#### Core Views Implementation
- ChecklistView: Shows active checklist with progress indicators
- TemplateBrowserView: Browse and select available templates
- SettingsView: Application configuration and preferences
- HelpView: Documentation, keybindings, and help content

#### Layout Patterns
- Single View: Full-screen content with header/footer
- Split View: Sidebar navigation + main content area
- Tabbed View: Multiple views accessible via tabs
- Modal/Overlay: Temporary content over current view

#### Performance Requirements
- View switching: <50ms (monitored via Performance Monitor from Story 1.7)
- State save/restore: <10ms
- Layout change: <30ms
- Support 10+ concurrent views in memory

### Testing

#### Testing Standards
From `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`:
- **Test Location**: `packages/tui/tests/views/`
- **Framework**: Bun test runner with native testing capabilities
- **Coverage Target**: >85% (critical TUI component)
- **Test Types**: Unit, integration, visual regression

#### Test File Structure
```

    ├── ViewSystemIntegration.test.ts
    └── TerminalCanvasIntegration.test.ts
```

#### Test Factory Usage
Use TestDataFactory from testing strategy for creating test views and layouts:
```typescript
const mockView = TestDataFactory.createView({
  id: 'test-view',
  title: 'Test View'
});
```

#### Visual Regression Testing
Use VisualRegressionTester for terminal output validation:
- Test view transitions
- Validate layout switching
- Verify modal/overlay rendering

### Coding Standards

From `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`:
- **ESLint**: Must pass all TypeScript rules, no `any` types
- **Prettier**: 80 character lines, TypeScript parser
- **Imports**: Use `@checklist/shared/types` for common types
- **Logging**: Use Pino logger from `@checklist/core/utils/logger`
- **Performance**: Use Bun-specific APIs where applicable

2. Implement NavigationStack for view history
3. Create LayoutManager for layout switching
4. Build individual view components
5. Add keyboard navigation handlers

## QA Results

### Requirements Traceability Assessment

**Coverage Summary:**
- Total Requirements: 10 acceptance criteria
- Fully Covered: 7 (70%) 
- Partially Covered: 3 (30%)
- Not Covered: 0 (0%)

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ Comprehensive view registry and navigation stack testing
- ✅ Robust state preservation validation across navigation
- ✅ Complete modal/overlay support testing
- ✅ Split-pane view functionality fully tested
- ✅ Strong error handling coverage

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
- 🔶 **AC7 (Tab switching)**: No tab-based view switching tests found
- 🔶 **AC4 (Layout patterns)**: Missing header/footer component tests
- 🔶 **AC8 (Keyboard shortcuts)**: No integration tests for navigation shortcuts
- 🔶 **AC10 (Responsive layout)**: No terminal resize/breakpoint tests

**Performance Coverage:**
- State save/restore: ✅ Tested
- View switching: ⚠️ Partially tested (timing validation needed)
- Layout changes: ⚠️ Partially tested (performance metrics needed)
- Concurrent views: ❌ Not tested (10+ view requirement)

**Integration Dependencies:**
- State Management (1.5): ✅ Validated
- Terminal Canvas (1.8): ✅ Validated  
- IoC Container (1.13): ⚠️ No dependency injection tests

**Risk Assessment:**
- **HIGH**: Tab functionality implementation verification needed
- **MEDIUM**: Layout components, keyboard navigation, responsive behavior
- **LOW**: Animation support (optional feature)

**Recommendations:**
1. Verify tab switching implementation exists and add comprehensive tests
2. Add layout component (header/footer) testing
3. Implement keyboard navigation integration tests
4. Add performance benchmarks for timing requirements
5. Test concurrent view handling (10+ views)
