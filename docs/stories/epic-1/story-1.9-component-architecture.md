## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree

Based on project structure in `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`:
- Place ViewSystem in `packages/tui/src/views/`
- Core view components in `packages/tui/src/views/components/`
- Layout management in `packages/tui/src/layout/`
- Navigation stack in `packages/tui/src/navigation/`

### Architecture Context

From `docs/architecture/components.md`, the component architecture shows:
- TUI Renderer is component #6 in initialization order
- ViewSystem will integrate with existing TUI Renderer
- Must work with State Manager (#2) for view state persistence
- Integrates with Performance Monitor (#8) for view switching metrics

### Dependencies Integration

**Story 1.5 (State Management)**: ViewSystem will use existing state management for:
- Persisting view state between sessions
- Managing navigation history
- Storing user preferences for layouts

**Story 1.8 (Terminal Canvas)**: ViewSystem will leverage terminal canvas for:
- Rendering view components
- Managing screen updates
- Handling terminal capabilities

**Story 1.13 (IoC Container)**: ViewSystem will be registered in dependency container for:
- Service injection
- Lifecycle management
- Cross-component communication

### Technical Implementation Details

#### ViewSystem Interface
```typescript
interface ViewSystem {
  // View Management
  registerView(id: string, view: View): void;
  navigateTo(viewId: string, params?: any): void;
  goBack(): void;
  canGoBack(): boolean;

  // Layout Management
  setLayout(layout: LayoutType): void;
  splitView(primary: string, secondary: string): void;

  // State Management
  saveViewState(viewId: string): void;
  restoreViewState(viewId: string): void;

  // Modal/Overlay
  showModal(modal: Modal): Promise<any>;
  showOverlay(overlay: Overlay): void;
  hideOverlay(): void;
}
```

#### Core Views Implementation
- ChecklistView: Shows active checklist with progress indicators
- TemplateBrowserView: Browse and select available templates
- SettingsView: Application configuration and preferences
- HelpView: Documentation, keybindings, and help content

#### Layout Patterns
- Single View: Full-screen content with header/footer
- Split View: Sidebar navigation + main content area
- Tabbed View: Multiple views accessible via tabs
- Modal/Overlay: Temporary content over current view

#### Performance Requirements
- View switching: <50ms (monitored via Performance Monitor from Story 1.7)
- State save/restore: <10ms
- Layout change: <30ms
- Support 10+ concurrent views in memory

### Testing

#### Testing Standards
From `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`:
- **Test Location**: `packages/tui/tests/views/`
- **Framework**: Bun test runner with native testing capabilities
- **Coverage Target**: >85% (critical TUI component)
- **Test Types**: Unit, integration, visual regression

#### Test File Structure
```

    └── TerminalCanvasIntegration.test.ts
```

#### Test Factory Usage
Use TestDataFactory from testing strategy for creating test views and layouts:
```typescript
const mockView = TestDataFactory.createView({
  id: 'test-view',
  title: 'Test View'
});
```

#### Visual Regression Testing
Use VisualRegressionTester for terminal output validation:
- Test view transitions
- Validate layout switching
- Verify modal/overlay rendering

### Coding Standards

From `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`:
- **ESLint**: Must pass all TypeScript rules, no `any` types
- **Prettier**: 80 character lines, TypeScript parser
- **Imports**: Use `@checklist/shared/types` for common types
- **Logging**: Use Pino logger from `@checklist/core/utils/logger`
- **Performance**: Use Bun-specific APIs where applicable

### File Creation Sequence
1. Create base ViewSystem interface and implementation
2. Implement NavigationStack for view history
3. Create LayoutManager for layout switching
4. Build individual view components
5. Add keyboard navigation handlers
6. Integrate with terminal canvas system
