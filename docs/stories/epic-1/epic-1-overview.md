# Epic 1: Foundation & Validation

## Goal
Establish the technical foundation with Bun/TypeScript, validate the hybrid TUI approach early through a technology spike, implement core business logic, and create robust state management.

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Bun project properly configured with TypeScript
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline operational from day one
- ✅ TUI approach validated (or fallback plan activated)
- ✅ Core workflow engine operational without UI
- ✅ Performance monitoring framework in place
- ✅ State persistence working with YAML files
- ✅ All operations complete in <100ms

## Stories
1. [Story 1.1: Project Setup and Structure](story-1.1-project-setup.md)
2. [Story 1.2: CI/CD Pipeline Foundation](story-1.2-cicd-pipeline.md) ⚠️ NEW - QUALITY GATE
3. [Story 1.3: TUI Technology Spike](story-1.3-tui-spike.md) ⚠️ CRITICAL PATH
4. [Story 1.4: Core Workflow Engine](story-1.4-workflow-engine.md)
5. [Story 1.5: Performance Monitoring Framework](story-1.5-performance-monitoring.md) ⚠️ NEW - EARLY WARNING
6. [Story 1.6: State Management Implementation](story-1.6-state-management.md)
7. [Story 1.7: Terminal Canvas System](story-1.7-terminal-canvas.md)
8. [Story 1.8: Component Base Architecture](story-1.8-component-architecture.md)

## Dependencies
- Story 0.0 must be complete (environment setup)
- Story 1.2 should be complete before heavy development (CI/CD)
- Story 1.3 blocks Stories 1.7 and 1.8 (TUI-dependent)
- Story 1.4 can proceed independently (no UI dependency)
- Story 1.5 should be early to catch performance issues

## Risk Factors
- 🔴 TUI spike failure could require architecture pivot
- 🟡 Bun compatibility issues with ecosystem
- 🟡 Performance targets aggressive for complex operations

## Timeline Estimate
**3-4 weeks** with new CI/CD and performance stories (was 2-3 weeks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline fully operational
- [ ] All unit tests passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (<100ms operations)
- [ ] Performance monitoring framework active
- [ ] Core engine works headless (no UI)
- [ ] State persistence verified
- [ ] TUI decision finalized (proceed or fallback)
- [ ] Documentation updated
