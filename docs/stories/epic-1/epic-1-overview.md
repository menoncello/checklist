# Epic 1: Foundation & Validation

## Goal
Establish the technical foundation with Bun/TypeScript, validate the hybrid TUI approach early through a technology spike, implement core business logic, and create robust state management.

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Bun project properly configured with TypeScript
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline operational from day one
- ✅ TUI approach validated (or fallback plan activated)
- ✅ Core workflow engine operational without UI
- ✅ Performance monitoring framework in place
- ✅ State persistence working with YAML files
- ✅ All operations complete in <100ms

## Stories
1. [Story 1.0: Database/State Store Setup](story-1.0-database-state-setup.md) ⚠️ NEW - CRITICAL FOUNDATION
2. [Story 1.1: Project Setup and Structure](story-1.1-project-setup.md)
3. [Story 1.2: CI/CD Pipeline + Third-Party Integration](story-1.2-cicd-pipeline.md) ⚠️ ENHANCED - QUALITY GATE
4. [Story 1.3: Testing Framework Setup](story-1.3-testing-framework.md) ⚠️ MOVED FROM 4.1 - ENABLES TDD
5. [Story 1.4: TUI Technology Spike](story-1.4-tui-spike.md) ⚠️ CRITICAL PATH (formerly 1.3)
6. [Story 1.5: State Management Implementation](story-1.5-state-management.md) (moved up from 1.6)
7. [Story 1.6: Core Workflow Engine](story-1.6-workflow-engine.md) (moved down from 1.4)
8. [Story 1.7: Performance Monitoring Framework](story-1.7-performance-monitoring.md) ⚠️ EARLY WARNING (moved up from 1.5)
9. [Story 1.8: Terminal Canvas System](story-1.8-terminal-canvas.md) (formerly 1.7)
10. [Story 1.9: Component Base Architecture](story-1.9-component-architecture.md) (formerly 1.8)

## Dependencies
- Story 0.0 must be complete (environment setup)
- Story 1.0 CRITICAL - must complete before 1.5, 1.6 (state-dependent stories)
- Story 1.2 should be complete before heavy development (CI/CD + integrations)
- Story 1.3 CRITICAL - enables TDD for all subsequent development
- Story 1.4 (TUI spike) blocks Stories 1.8 and 1.9 (TUI-dependent)
- Story 1.5 (state management) depends on 1.0 and blocks 1.6
- Story 1.6 (workflow engine) depends on 1.0 and 1.5
- Story 1.7 should be early to catch performance issues

## Risk Factors
- 🔴 TUI spike failure could require architecture pivot
- 🔴 Database/state corruption without proper file locking (MITIGATED by Story 1.0)
- 🟡 Third-party integration failures across platforms (MITIGATED by Story 1.2)
- 🟡 Bun compatibility issues with ecosystem
- 🟡 Performance targets aggressive for complex operations
- 🟡 Late testing setup leading to technical debt (MITIGATED by Story 1.3)

## Timeline Estimate
**4-5 weeks** with new critical foundation stories (was 2-3 weeks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Database/state store operational with file locking and backup systems
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline fully operational with third-party integrations
- [ ] Testing framework established enabling TDD practices
- [ ] All unit tests passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (<100ms operations)
- [ ] Performance monitoring framework active
- [ ] Core engine works headless (no UI)
- [ ] State persistence verified with transaction logging
- [ ] TUI decision finalized (proceed or fallback)
- [ ] Third-party integrations tested across all platforms
- [ ] Documentation updated
