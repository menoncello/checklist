# Epic 1: Foundation & Validation

## Status: 🚧 IN PROGRESS (65% Complete - 13/20 stories)

## Goal

Establish the technical foundation with Bun/TypeScript, validate the hybrid TUI approach early through a technology spike, implement core business logic, and create robust state management.

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Bun project properly configured with TypeScript
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline operational from day one
- ✅ TUI approach validated (or fallback plan activated)
- ✅ Core workflow engine operational without UI
- ✅ Performance monitoring framework in place
- ✅ State persistence working with YAML files
- ✅ All operations complete in <100ms

## Dependencies

- Story 0.0 must be complete (environment setup)
- Story 1.0 CRITICAL - must complete before 1.5, 1.6 (state-dependent stories)
- Story 1.2 should be complete before heavy development (CI/CD + integrations)
- Story 1.3 CRITICAL - enables TDD for all subsequent development
- Story 1.4 (TUI spike) blocks Stories 1.8 and 1.9 (TUI-dependent)
- Story 1.5 (state management) depends on 1.0 and blocks 1.6
- Story 1.6 (workflow engine) depends on 1.0 and 1.5
- Story 1.7 should be early to catch performance issues

## Risk Factors

### ✅ Mitigated Risks
- ~~🔴 TUI spike failure could require architecture pivot~~ **RESOLVED - Spike passed**
- ~~🔴 Database/state corruption without proper file locking~~ **MITIGATED by Story 1.0**
- ~~🟡 Third-party integration failures across platforms~~ **MITIGATED by Story 1.2**
- ~~🟡 Late testing setup leading to technical debt~~ **MITIGATED by Story 1.3**

### ⚠️ Remaining Risks
- 🟡 Performance targets aggressive for complex operations (Stories 1.7, 1.14 address this)
- 🟡 Bun compatibility issues with ecosystem (monitoring ongoing)

## Timeline Estimate

**4-5 weeks** with new critical foundation stories (was 2-3 weeks)

## Definition of Done
