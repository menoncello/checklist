# Story 1.4: TUI Technology Spike

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to validate the hybrid TUI approach with a working prototype,  
**so that** we confirm technical feasibility before committing to full implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Test three TUI implementation approaches (Ink/React, Pure ANSI, Hybrid/Blessed-like)
2. Achieve performance benchmarks: <50ms startup, <100ms for 1000 item render, <50MB memory
3. Validate cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows terminals)
4. Confirm Bun runtime compatibility with chosen approach
5. Document Go/No-Go decision with scoring (75+ points = proceed, 50-74 = hybrid, <50 = CLI fallback)
6. Deliver working proof of concept for recommended approach
7. Complete spike within 3-day timebox

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.3 (Testing Framework) established the testing infrastructure using Bun Test with node-pty for terminal emulation. This will be critical for validating TUI approaches.

### Technical Stack

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Runtime**: Bun 1.1.x (high performance, built-in tooling)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.3.x
- **TUI Framework**: Custom ANSI 1.0.0 (current plan, to be validated)
- **Terminal Detection**: supports-color 9.4.x
- **TUI Testing**: node-pty 1.0.x for terminal emulation
- **Snapshot Testing**: Bun Test Snapshots (built-in)
- **Performance Testing**: Tinybench 2.5.x for micro-benchmarks

### Project Structure

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Spike code should be created in: `packages/tui/spike/`
- Test files should be in: `packages/tui/spike/tests/`
- Documentation outputs go to: `docs/architecture/decisions/`

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Must follow ESLint configuration with TypeScript rules
- Use Bun.env instead of process.env
- Prettier formatting: 2 spaces, semicolons, single quotes
- No console.log (use debug logger)

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy-complete-with-all-testing-utilities.md]
- Use TestDataFactory for creating test data
- Create TestWorkspace for isolated testing environments
- Must achieve <100ms operation requirement
- Use Bun Test runner with built-in coverage

### Performance Scoring Rubric

**Performance (40 points)**
- Startup <50ms: 10pts
- Render <100ms: 15pts  
- Memory <50MB: 15pts

**Compatibility (30 points)**
- Works on all platforms: 15pts
- Works with Bun: 15pts

**Functionality (20 points)**
- Scrolling works: 5pts
- Keyboard navigation: 5pts
- Resize handling: 5pts
- No flicker: 5pts

**Maintainability (10 points)**
- Code complexity: 5pts
- Dependency count: 5pts

### Implementation Patterns

Each approach test should follow this structure:

```typescript
// spike-test.ts
import { performance } from 'perf_hooks';

interface SpikeResult {
  approach: string;
  success: boolean;
  metrics: {
    startupTime: number;
    renderTime: number;
    memoryUsed: number;
    fps: number;
  };
  issues: string[];
}
```

### Critical Path Warning

This story is on the **CRITICAL PATH** and blocks stories 1.8 (Terminal Canvas) and 1.9 (Component Architecture). The 3-day timebox is a hard constraint. Have CLI fallback ready per mitigation plan if TUI approach fails validation.

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy-complete-with-all-testing-utilities.md]

- Test file location: `packages/tui/spike/tests/`
- Use Bun Test runner for all tests
- Create performance benchmarks using Tinybench
- Use node-pty for terminal emulation tests
- Snapshot testing for visual validation
- Coverage target: Not applicable for spike (this is exploratory)

### Specific Test Requirements

1. Performance benchmark suite measuring all metrics
2. Cross-platform compatibility test matrix
3. Memory leak detection tests
4. Terminal resize event handling tests
5. Keyboard input handling tests

## QA Results

### Risk Profile Analysis - 2025-01-06
**Reviewer**: Quinn (Test Architect)
**Risk Score**: 21/100 (High Risk - Immediate attention required)
**Risk Profile**: docs/qa/assessments/1.4-tui-spike-risk-20250106.md

#### Critical Risks Identified (Score 9)
1. **TECH-001**: Wrong TUI Approach Selection
   - High probability of selecting suboptimal approach
   - Blocks stories 1.8 and 1.9 on critical path
   - **Mitigation**: Strict rubric adherence, test all approaches, CLI fallback ready

2. **TECH-002**: Bun Runtime Incompatibility  
   - Many TUI libraries untested with Bun
   - Could force architecture-level runtime change
   - **Mitigation**: Early Bun-specific testing, document workarounds

#### High Priority Risks (Score 6)
- **PERF-001**: Performance targets (<50ms startup, <100ms render) at risk
- **TECH-003**: Cross-platform terminal compatibility issues
- **OPS-001**: 3-day timebox may compromise documentation quality

#### Risk Summary for Gate
```yaml
risk_summary:
  totals:
    critical: 2
    high: 3
    medium: 4
    low: 3
  highest:
    id: TECH-001
    score: 9
    title: 'Wrong TUI approach selection'
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Test all approaches with Bun 1.1.x before selection'
      - 'Ensure performance benchmarks are accurately measured'
      - 'Have CLI fallback implementation ready'
    monitor:
      - 'Memory usage during extended sessions'
      - 'Cross-platform compatibility issues'
      - 'Adherence to 3-day timebox'
```

#### Testing Requirements
1. **Critical**: Bun runtime compatibility suite
2. **Critical**: Performance benchmark suite (startup, render, memory)
3. **High**: Cross-platform matrix (macOS, Linux, Windows, SSH, tmux)
4. **High**: Stress testing with large datasets
5. **Medium**: Visual regression and snapshot testing

#### Decision Impact
- Score <50 requires CLI fallback activation
- Current risk score of 21/100 makes CLI fallback **essential**
- Recommend feature flags for TUI/CLI mode switching

### Test Design Analysis - 2025-01-06
**Test Design**: docs/qa/assessments/1.4-tui-spike-test-design-20250106.md

#### Test Coverage Summary
- **Total Scenarios**: 31 tests designed
- **Distribution**: 12 Unit (39%), 13 Integration (42%), 6 E2E (19%)
- **Priority**: 15 P0 (must pass), 10 P1 (should pass), 6 P2 (nice to have)

#### Critical Test Areas (P0)
1. **Bun Runtime Compatibility** - All 3 approaches must work with Bun 1.1.x
2. **Performance Benchmarks** - Must meet <50ms startup, <100ms render, <50MB memory
3. **Platform Compatibility** - Must work on macOS, Linux, Windows terminals
4. **Basic Rendering** - Each approach must render without crashes

#### Test Execution Phases
**Day 1**: Core validation (unit tests, runtime compatibility)
**Day 2**: Performance & platform testing (benchmarks, cross-platform)
**Day 3**: Scoring, decision, and POC validation

#### Test Data Requirements
- Performance datasets: 10 (smoke), 1000 (benchmark), 10000 (stress) items
- Platform matrix: 3 OS × multiple terminals + SSH/tmux
- Edge cases: Empty lists, maximum terminal size

#### Success/Fail Criteria
**Pass**: All P0 tests pass, performance targets met, Bun compatible, score ≥50
**Fail**: Any P0 failure without mitigation, performance >50% off target, Bun crashes

### Requirements Traceability Analysis - 2025-01-06

    none: 2
  planning_ref: 'docs/qa/assessments/1.4-tui-spike-test-design-20250106.md'
  uncovered:
    - ac: 'AC1 (partial)'

    - ac: 'AC3 (partial)'
      reason: 'No explicit Windows terminal testing'
    - ac: 'IR4-IR7'
      reason: 'UI interaction tests (flicker, keyboard, scrolling) not implemented'
  notes: 'See docs/qa/assessments/1.4-tui-spike-trace-20250106.md'
```

#### Coverage Analysis (87% Total)
- **AC1**: Test three approaches - PARTIAL (2/3 tested, Ink missing)
- **AC2**: Performance benchmarks - FULL (all metrics tested)
- **AC3**: Cross-platform - PARTIAL (Windows not tested)
- **AC4**: Bun compatibility - FULL (all tests run in Bun)
- **AC5**: Go/No-Go scoring - FULL (decision logic tested)
- **AC6**: POC delivery - PARTIAL (created but not tested)
- **AC7**: Timebox - NOT TESTABLE (process constraint)

#### Given-When-Then Test Mappings

**Critical Tests Validated**:
1. **Performance Testing** (`spike.test.ts::Performance Measurement`)
   - Given: Performance measurement utility
   - When: Recording frames and memory usage
   - Then: Metrics meet targets (<50ms startup, <100ms render, <50MB memory)

2. **Bun Compatibility** (`spike.test.ts::ANSI/Hybrid Approach`)
   - Given: Bun 1.1.x runtime environment  
   - When: Executing approach implementations
   - Then: bunCompatible flag returns true, no runtime errors

3. **Decision Logic** (`spike.test.ts::Decision Logic`)
   - Given: Score values from 40-80 points
   - When: Applying Go/No-Go thresholds
   - Then: Correct decisions (GO ≥75, Hybrid 50-74, NO-GO <50)

#### Critical Gaps Requiring Attention
1. **Ink/React Approach** - Test implementation exists but no test coverage
2. **Windows Compatibility** - Platform flag exists but no explicit testing
3. **UI Interactions** - No tests for keyboard, scrolling, resize, or flicker detection

#### Traceability Gate Impact
- Requirements with test coverage: 13/15 (87%)
- Critical path coverage: 90% (Ink tests missing)
- Recommendation: **PASS with CONCERNS** - Core functionality tested but gaps in approach coverage
