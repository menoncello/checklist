# Story 1.4: TUI Technology Spike

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to validate the hybrid TUI approach with a working prototype,  
**so that** we confirm technical feasibility before committing to full implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Test three TUI implementation approaches (Ink/React, Pure ANSI, Hybrid/Blessed-like)
2. Achieve performance benchmarks: <50ms startup, <100ms for 1000 item render, <50MB memory
3. Validate cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows terminals)
4. Confirm Bun runtime compatibility with chosen approach
5. Document Go/No-Go decision with scoring (75+ points = proceed, 50-74 = hybrid, <50 = CLI fallback)
6. Deliver working proof of concept for recommended approach
7. Complete spike within 3-day timebox

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Day 1: Implementation Setup (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Set up test harness in packages/tui/spike/
  - [ ] Implement Approach 1: Ink (React-based) test
  - [ ] Implement Approach 2: Pure ANSI/Custom renderer
  - [ ] Implement Approach 3: Hybrid Blessed-like approach
  - [ ] Create performance measurement utilities

- [ ] Day 2: Testing & Benchmarking (AC: 2, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Run performance tests for each approach (startup, render, memory)
  - [ ] Test macOS compatibility (Terminal.app, iTerm2)
  - [ ] Test Linux compatibility (GNOME Terminal)
  - [ ] Test Windows compatibility (Windows Terminal)
  - [ ] Test SSH session compatibility
  - [ ] Test tmux compatibility
  - [ ] Validate Bun runtime compatibility

- [ ] Day 3: Analysis & Decision (AC: 5, 6, 7)
  - [ ] Calculate scores using 100-point rubric
  - [ ] Generate spike-results.md report
  - [ ] Create proof of concept for winning approach
  - [ ] Document Go/No-Go decision in decision-tui.md
  - [ ] If No-Go: Activate mitigation plan
  - [ ] Update architecture documents based on decision

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.3 (Testing Framework) established the testing infrastructure using Bun Test with node-pty for terminal emulation. This will be critical for validating TUI approaches.

### Technical Stack

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Runtime**: Bun 1.1.x (high performance, built-in tooling)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.3.x
- **TUI Framework**: Custom ANSI 1.0.0 (current plan, to be validated)
- **Terminal Detection**: supports-color 9.4.x
- **TUI Testing**: node-pty 1.0.x for terminal emulation
- **Snapshot Testing**: Bun Test Snapshots (built-in)
- **Performance Testing**: Tinybench 2.5.x for micro-benchmarks

### Project Structure

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Spike code should be created in: `packages/tui/spike/`
- Test files should be in: `packages/tui/spike/tests/`
- Documentation outputs go to: `docs/architecture/decisions/`

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Must follow ESLint configuration with TypeScript rules
- Use Bun.env instead of process.env
- Prettier formatting: 2 spaces, semicolons, single quotes
- No console.log (use debug logger)

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy-complete-with-all-testing-utilities.md]
- Use TestDataFactory for creating test data
- Create TestWorkspace for isolated testing environments
- Must achieve <100ms operation requirement
- Use Bun Test runner with built-in coverage

### Performance Scoring Rubric

**Performance (40 points)**
- Startup <50ms: 10pts
- Render <100ms: 15pts  
- Memory <50MB: 15pts

**Compatibility (30 points)**
- Works on all platforms: 15pts
- Works with Bun: 15pts

**Functionality (20 points)**
- Scrolling works: 5pts
- Keyboard navigation: 5pts
- Resize handling: 5pts
- No flicker: 5pts

**Maintainability (10 points)**
- Code complexity: 5pts
- Dependency count: 5pts

### Implementation Patterns

Each approach test should follow this structure:

```typescript
// spike-test.ts
import { performance } from 'perf_hooks';

interface SpikeResult {
  approach: string;
  success: boolean;
  metrics: {
    startupTime: number;
    renderTime: number;
    memoryUsed: number;
    fps: number;
  };
  issues: string[];
}
```

### Critical Path Warning

This story is on the **CRITICAL PATH** and blocks stories 1.8 (Terminal Canvas) and 1.9 (Component Architecture). The 3-day timebox is a hard constraint. Have CLI fallback ready per mitigation plan if TUI approach fails validation.

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy-complete-with-all-testing-utilities.md]

- Test file location: `packages/tui/spike/tests/`
- Use Bun Test runner for all tests
- Create performance benchmarks using Tinybench
- Use node-pty for terminal emulation tests
- Snapshot testing for visual validation
- Coverage target: Not applicable for spike (this is exploratory)

### Specific Test Requirements

1. Performance benchmark suite measuring all metrics
2. Cross-platform compatibility test matrix
3. Memory leak detection tests
4. Terminal resize event handling tests
5. Keyboard input handling tests
