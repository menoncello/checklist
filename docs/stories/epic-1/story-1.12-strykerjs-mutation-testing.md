## Testing

### Test Strategy
- **Mutation Testing**: Achieve 85% minimum mutation score across all modules
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure mutation testing completes within CI timeout
- **Integration Testing**: Verify StrykerJS works correctly with Bun test runner
- **Report Validation**: Confirm HTML and JSON reports are generated correctly

### StrykerJS Configuration for Bun

**Correct Configuration for Bun Support:**

```javascript
// stryker.conf.js
module.exports = {
  packageManager: 'npm',  // Required for StrykerJS
  testRunner: 'command',   // Use command runner for Bun
  commandRunner: {
    command: 'bun test --bail --coverage'  // Execute Bun directly
  },
  mutate: ['packages/*/src/**/*.ts', '!**/*.test.ts', '!**/*.spec.ts'],
  thresholds: { high: 95, low: 90, break: 85 },
  reporters: ['html', 'json', 'progress', 'dashboard'],
  htmlReporter: {
    fileName: 'reports/mutation/index.html'
  },
  incremental: true,
  incrementalFile: '.stryker-tmp/incremental.json',
  concurrency: 4,
  timeoutMS: 60000,
  disableTypeChecks: false
};
```

### Package.json Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "bun test",
    "test:mutation": "bunx stryker run",
    "test:mutation:incremental": "bunx stryker run --incremental"
  }
}
```

### Validation Steps
1. Run mutation tests locally: `bunx stryker run`
2. Verify HTML report: Open `reports/mutation/index.html`
3. Check mutation score meets 85% threshold
4. Validate incremental mode: `bunx stryker run --incremental`
5. Test CI integration: Push changes and verify GitHub Actions

```

**Testing Infrastructure** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy-complete-with-all-testing-utilities.md#mutation-testing-strategy]:
- StrykerJS version 9.1.x (latest stable version - supersedes architecture doc 8.2.x)
- Command runner configuration for Bun compatibility
- Mutation score threshold: 85% minimum (break), 90% low, 95% high
- Reports output to `reports/mutation/` directory as per source tree structure
- Incremental testing file stored in `.stryker-tmp/incremental.json`
- Dashboard token stored as GitHub Secret: `STRYKER_DASHBOARD_API_TOKEN`

**Tech Stack Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#testing-suite]:
- StrykerJS 9.1.x for mutation testing (latest stable - supersedes tech-stack.md 8.2.x)
- Bun Test (built-in) for unit and integration tests
- Bun Coverage (built-in) for coverage reporting
- npm audit (built-in) for security scanning dependencies

**Security Configuration**:
- Dashboard API token: Store in GitHub Secrets as `STRYKER_DASHBOARD_API_TOKEN`
- Access in CI: `${{ secrets.STRYKER_DASHBOARD_API_TOKEN }}`
- Local development: Use `.env.local` (gitignored) with `STRYKER_DASHBOARD_API_TOKEN=your-token`

**Project Structure Alignment** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#project-structure]:
- Configuration file: `stryker.conf.js` in project root
- Reports directory: `reports/mutation/` for HTML reports
- Temporary files: `.stryker-tmp/` for incremental testing cache
- Test files location: `packages/*/tests/` following monorepo structure

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#eslint-configuration-rules]:
- Follow ESLint rules for TypeScript code quality
- No console.log - use Pino logger instead
- Mandatory security rules: no-eval, no-unsafe-regex
- Import organization must follow defined groups

### Bun Compatibility for StrykerJS

**Issue:** StrykerJS does not natively support Bun as a test runner or package manager.

**Solution:** Use command runner to execute Bun tests:
1. Use `bunx` to execute StrykerJS directly without installing globally
2. Configure command runner to execute `bun test`
3. This allows StrykerJS to mutate code while using Bun for test execution

### CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions Workflow Structure:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  mutation-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      - run: bun install
      
      # Cache for faster builds
      - uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: |
            ~/.bun/install/cache
            .stryker-tmp
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-bun-stryker-${{ hashFiles('**/bun.lockb') }}
      
      # Run mutation testing
      - name: Mutation Testing
        env:
          STRYKER_DASHBOARD_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.STRYKER_DASHBOARD_API_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          if [ "${{ github.event_name }}" = "pull_request" ]; then
            bunx stryker run --incremental
          else
            bunx stryker run --reporters dashboard,html,json
          fi
      
      # Upload reports
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: mutation-report
          path: reports/mutation/
```

### Mutation Testing Goals by Module

| Module | Target Score | Priority | Notes |
|--------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Workflow Engine | 95% | P0 | Critical business logic |
| Core Utils | 90% | P0 | Foundation utilities |
| State Management | 85% | P1 | Complex state handling |
| CLI Commands | 85% | P1 | User-facing functionality |
| TUI Components | 80% | P2 | Visual components |
| Test Utilities | 75% | P3 | Testing infrastructure |

### Performance Considerations
- Mutation testing is CPU-intensive
- Configure concurrency based on available cores
- Use incremental mode for PR validation
- Full mutation testing only on main branch merges
- Consider using `--since` flag for changed files only

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Timeout Errors**:
   - Increase `timeoutMS` in configuration
   - Reduce concurrency if memory-constrained
   - Use `--logLevel debug` for diagnostics

2. **False Positives**:
   - Some mutants may be equivalent (no behavioral change)
   - Document known equivalent mutants
   - Use `// Stryker disable` comments sparingly

3. **Performance Issues**:
   - Use incremental mode for local development
   - Configure file filters to exclude generated code
   - Optimize test suite for faster execution

## QA Results

### Requirements Traceability Analysis - 2025-01-09 (Updated)

**Coverage Summary:**
- Total Requirements: 8 
- Fully Covered: 6 (75%)
- Partially Covered: 2 (25%)
- Not Covered: 0 (0%)

**Traceability Matrix:** `docs/qa/assessments/1.12-trace-20250109.md`

**Key Findings:**

✅ **Fully Covered (AC1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8):**
- **AC1**: StrykerJS configured with Bun command runner (`stryker.conf.js:9-14`) - validated with 62.32% mutation score on validation.ts
- **AC2**: Mutation threshold 85% enforced (`stryker.conf.js:35-40`, `.github/workflows/mutation.yml:144-160`)
- **AC4**: All default mutators enabled - verified through 69 mutants with various mutation types
- **AC5**: HTML reporter operational (`stryker.conf.js:43-48`) with CI artifact upload
- **AC6**: Incremental testing working (`stryker.conf.js:55-61`) with cache management
- **AC8**: Parallel execution with 4 threads (`stryker.conf.js:64-65`) and performance optimizations

⚠️ **Partially Covered:**
- **AC3 (CI/CD Integration):** 
  - ✅ PR incremental testing (`.github/workflows/mutation.yml:50-57`)
  - ✅ Main branch full testing with threshold check
  - ❌ Dashboard upload will fail without token
- **AC7 (Dashboard Integration):** 
  - ✅ Configuration present (`stryker.conf.js:101-108`)
  - ❌ Project not registered on dashboard.stryker-mutator.io
  - ❌ STRYKER_DASHBOARD_API_TOKEN not in GitHub Secrets
  - ❌ Webhook notifications not configured

**Test Coverage Gaps (Task 4 Subtasks):**
- Core Module: Current 62.32% vs 90% target
- State Management: Tests pending (85% target)
- CLI Module: Tests pending (85% target)
- Workflow Engine: Tests pending (95% target)

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Low Risk**: Core infrastructure operational with Bun compatibility solved
