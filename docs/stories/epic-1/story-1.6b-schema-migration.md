# Story 1.6b: Schema Migration System

## Status

**Done**

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** automatic state file migration when updating the tool,  
**So that** my checklists continue working across versions.

## Priority

**HIGH** - Must be complete before first release

## Acceptance Criteria

### Migration Framework

1. ‚úÖ Schema version embedded in state files
2. ‚úÖ Automatic backup before migration
3. ‚úÖ Migration scripts run on version mismatch
4. ‚úÖ Rollback capability if migration fails
5. ‚úÖ User notification of migration status

### Version Detection

1. ‚úÖ Detect state file version on load
2. ‚úÖ Compare with current application version
3. ‚úÖ Determine migration path if needed
4. ‚úÖ Handle missing version info (assume v0)
5. ‚úÖ Support skipping versions in migration path

## Technical Implementation

### Migration Registry

```typescript
interface Migration {
  fromVersion: string;
  toVersion: string;
  description: string;
  up: (state: any) => any;
  down: (state: any) => any;
  validate?: (state: any) => boolean;
}

class MigrationRegistry {
  private migrations: Migration[] = [
    {
      fromVersion: '0.0.0',
      toVersion: '0.1.0',
      description: 'Initial schema with basic fields',
      up: (state) => ({
        version: '0.1.0',
        checklists: state.checklists || [],
        settings: state.settings || {},
        metadata: {
          created: state.created || new Date().toISOString(),
          modified: new Date().toISOString(),
        },
      }),
      down: (state) => {
        const { version, metadata, ...rest } = state;
        return rest;
      },
    },
    {
      fromVersion: '0.1.0',
      toVersion: '0.2.0',
      description: 'Add template support and variables',
      up: (state) => ({
        ...state,
        version: '0.2.0',
        templates: [],
        variables: {},
        metadata: {
          ...state.metadata,
          modified: new Date().toISOString(),
        },
      }),
      down: (state) => {
        const { templates, variables, ...rest } = state;
        return { ...rest, version: '0.1.0' };
      },
      validate: (state) => {
        return Array.isArray(state.templates) && typeof state.variables === 'object';
      },
    },
  ];

  findPath(from: string, to: string): Migration[] {
    // Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path
    const path: Migration[] = [];
    let current = from;

    while (current !== to) {
      const next = this.migrations.find((m) => m.fromVersion === current);
      if (!next) throw new Error(`No migration path from ${from} to ${to}`);
      path.push(next);
      current = next.toVersion;
    }

    return path;
  }
}
```

### Migration Runner

```typescript
class MigrationRunner {
  private registry = new MigrationRegistry();
  private backupDir = '.checklist/backups';

  async migrate(statePath: string): Promise<void> {
    // Load current state
    const currentState = await this.loadState(statePath);
    const currentVersion = currentState.version || '0.0.0';
    const targetVersion = APP_VERSION;

    if (currentVersion === targetVersion) {
      console.log('‚úÖ State file is up to date');
      return;
    }

    // Create backup
    await this.createBackup(statePath, currentVersion);

    // Find migration path
    const migrations = this.registry.findPath(currentVersion, targetVersion);

    if (migrations.length === 0) {
      console.log('‚úÖ No migrations needed');
      return;
    }

    // Show migration plan
    console.log(`üì¶ Migrating from v${currentVersion} to v${targetVersion}`);
    console.log(`üìã ${migrations.length} migration(s) to apply:`);
    migrations.forEach((m) => {
      console.log(`  ‚Ä¢ v${m.fromVersion} ‚Üí v${m.toVersion}: ${m.description}`);
    });

    // Apply migrations
    let state = currentState;
    for (const migration of migrations) {
      console.log(`‚è≥ Applying migration to v${migration.toVersion}...`);

      try {
        state = migration.up(state);

        // Validate if validator exists
        if (migration.validate && !migration.validate(state)) {
          throw new Error('Migration validation failed');
        }

        // Save intermediate state
        await this.saveState(statePath, state);
        console.log(`‚úÖ Migrated to v${migration.toVersion}`);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`‚ùå Migration failed: ${error.message}`);
        await this.rollback(statePath, currentVersion);
        throw error;
      }
    }

    console.log(`üéâ Successfully migrated to v${targetVersion}`);
  }

  async createBackup(statePath: string, version: string): Promise<string> {
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().replace(/[:.]/g, '-');
    const backupName = `backup-v${version}-${timestamp}.yaml`;
    const backupPath = path.join(this.backupDir, backupName);

    // Ensure backup directory exists
    await fs.mkdir(this.backupDir, { recursive: true });

    // Copy state file to backup
    await fs.copyFile(statePath, backupPath);

    console.log(`üíæ Backup created: ${backupPath}`);
    return backupPath;
  }

  async rollback(statePath: string, version: string): Promise<void> {
    // Find most recent backup for version
    const backups = await fs.readdir(this.backupDir);
    const versionBackups = backups
      .filter((f) => f.includes(`v${version}`))
      .sort()
      .reverse();

    if (versionBackups.length === 0) {
      throw new Error(`No backup found for v${version}`);
    }

    const backupPath = path.join(this.backupDir, versionBackups[0]);
    await fs.copyFile(backupPath, statePath);

    console.log(`‚Ü©Ô∏è Rolled back to v${version} from ${backupPath}`);
  }
}
```

### Schema Versioning

```typescript
interface StateSchema {
  version: string;
  checklists: Checklist[];
  templates?: Template[];
  variables?: Record<string, Variable>;
  settings: Settings;
  metadata: {
    created: string;
    modified: string;
    lastMigration?: string;
  };
}

// Version detection utility
async function detectVersion(state: any): string {
  if (state.version) return state.version;

  // Heuristics for detecting version from structure
  if (state.templates && state.variables) return '0.2.0';
  if (state.metadata) return '0.1.0';
  if (state.checklists) return '0.0.0';

  return '0.0.0'; // Unknown structure, assume oldest
}
```

### CLI Integration

```bash
# Check current state version
checklist migrate --check

# Perform migration (automatic on normal run)
checklist migrate

# Create backup without migrating
checklist migrate --backup-only

# List available backups
checklist migrate --list-backups

# Restore from specific backup
checklist migrate --restore=backup-v0.1.0-2024-01-15.yaml

# Dry run migration (show what would change)
checklist migrate --dry-run
```

- üü° Large state files may be slow to migrate
- üü¢ Well-established patterns from database migrations

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights (from Story 1.6a WAL Implementation)

- **WAL Implementation Completed**: WriteAheadLog class with atomic operations at `/packages/core/src/state/WriteAheadLog.ts`
- **TransactionCoordinator Enhanced**: Now supports WAL integration at `/packages/core/src/state/TransactionCoordinator.ts` 
- **State Manager Foundation**: StateManager class already exists at `/packages/core/src/state/StateManager.ts`
- **Existing Test Patterns**: See `/packages/core/tests/state/WriteAheadLog.test.ts` for Bun test patterns
- **Performance Baseline**: WAL operations complete in <1ms for small operations, ~260ms for large recoveries
- **Security Measures**: Path validation and rate limiting already implemented in WAL

### State File Schema Requirements

[Source: architecture/database-schema-complete-with-all-enhancements.md#state-file-schema]

**Current Schema Version**: 1.0.0

**State File Structure** (`.checklist/state.yaml`):
```yaml
schemaVersion: '1.0.0'
migrations:  # Track applied migrations
  - from: '0.9.0'
    to: '1.0.0'
    applied: '2025-01-01T00:00:00Z'
    changes:
      - 'Added commandResults to completedSteps'
version: '1.0.0'
checksum: 'sha256:abc123...'
lastModified: '2025-01-01T10:00:00Z'
```

**Required State File Fields**:
- `schemaVersion`: Version of the schema structure
- `migrations`: Array tracking all applied migrations
- `version`: Current state file version
- `checksum`: SHA256 hash for integrity validation
- `activeInstance`: Current checklist execution state
- `recovery`: Recovery information from corruptions
- `conflicts`: Concurrent modification tracking

### File System Structure

[Source: architecture/database-schema-complete-with-all-enhancements.md#file-structure]

```
.checklist/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state.yaml          # Main state file with migrations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yaml         # User configuration  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ history.yaml        # Execution history
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .backup/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.yaml   # Backup metadata
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ state.yaml.*    # Backup files
```

### Implementation Location

[Source: architecture/backend-architecture-complete-with-all-services.md]

- **Migration Classes**: Create in `/packages/core/src/state/migrations/`
- **MigrationRegistry**: `/packages/core/src/state/migrations/MigrationRegistry.ts`
- **MigrationRunner**: `/packages/core/src/state/migrations/MigrationRunner.ts`
- **Migration Scripts**: `/packages/core/src/state/migrations/scripts/`
- **Tests**: `/packages/core/tests/state/migrations/`

### Technology Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **File Operations**: Use `Bun.file()` and `Bun.write()` for 10x faster I/O
- **YAML Parsing**: Use `js-yaml 4.1.x` for state file handling
- **Schema Validation**: Use `Ajv 8.12.x` for JSON schema validation
- **Process Management**: Use `Bun.spawn()` for any CLI operations

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#bun-specific-performance-standards]

```typescript
// ALWAYS use Bun.file() for file operations
const file = Bun.file(path);
const content = await file.text();

// ALWAYS use Bun.write() for file writes  
await Bun.write(path, content);

// Use atomic writes for state files
// Write to temp file first, then rename
```

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy-complete-with-all-testing-utilities.md]

- **Test Location**: `/packages/core/tests/state/migrations/`
- **Test Framework**: Bun Test (built-in)
- **Coverage Target**: >90% for critical paths
- **Performance Tests**: Use Tinybench for benchmarking
- **Test Patterns**:
  - Unit tests for each migration script
  - Integration tests for migration paths
  - Performance benchmarks for large state files
  - Corruption recovery tests

### Integration Points

- **StateManager**: Hook into existing `loadState()` method to trigger migrations
- **TransactionCoordinator**: Use for atomic migration operations
- **WriteAheadLog**: Consider WAL for migration rollback safety
- **WorkflowEngine**: Ensure migrations don't break active workflows

### Performance Constraints

[Source: architecture/backend-architecture-complete-with-all-services.md]

- Migration operations must complete in <500ms for typical files
- Use streaming for large state files (>10MB)
- Implement progress indicators for long migrations
- Cache migration results to avoid re-running

### Security Considerations

- Validate all state files before migration (prevent injection)
- Use checksums to verify integrity pre/post migration
- Implement file locking during migration operations
- Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal

## Notes for Developers

- Keep migrations idempotent where possible
- Always validate state after migration
- Consider compression for old backups
- Document breaking changes clearly
- Test with real-world state files from beta users
- Follow existing patterns from WAL implementation for file operations
- Use TransactionCoordinator for atomic operations
- Ensure backward compatibility for at least 3 major versions
