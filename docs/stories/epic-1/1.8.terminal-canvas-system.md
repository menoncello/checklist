## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.7 (Performance Monitoring Framework):
- PerformanceMonitor service available via DI container registration
- @Timed decorator available for method performance tracking
- Performance targets: <50ms startup, <16ms screen transitions, <10ms keyboard response
- Memory baseline <50MB with monitoring infrastructure in place
- Full Pino logging infrastructure operational with structured logging

### Tech Stack Decisions
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **TUI Framework**: Custom ANSI (1.0.0) - Full control, optimal performance
- **Terminal Detection**: supports-color (9.4.x) - Graceful degradation
- **CLI Parser**: Bun.argv (Built-in) - Native Bun argument parsing
- **Performance Testing**: Tinybench (2.5.x) - Validates <100ms requirement
- **Logging**: Pino (9.x) - Production-ready logging integration

### Component Architecture Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/components.md]
- Component initialization follows strict dependency order
- TUI Renderer initializes after Performance Monitor and Plugin System
- Must implement Disposable pattern for resource management
- Use WeakMap/WeakSet for object metadata to prevent memory leaks

### File Structure and Locations
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- TUI package location: `packages/tui/src/`
- Core interfaces: `packages/core/src/interfaces/`
- Tests colocated: `packages/tui/src/*.test.ts`
- Performance benchmarks: `packages/tui/tests/benchmarks/`

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Always use Bun.env instead of process.env
- Implement Disposable pattern with [Symbol.dispose]() for cleanup
- Use structured logging with Pino child loggers for component context
- Always buffer terminal operations for performance
- Check terminal capabilities before using advanced features
- Handle resize events with proper cleanup and re-render

### Data Models
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
- Components follow Step interface patterns with proper lifecycle management
- Event handling should support both sequential and parallel execution modes
- State management must be immutable with structured cloning for deep copies

### Performance Requirements
- Application startup <50ms
- Screen transition <16ms  
- Keyboard response <10ms
- Memory usage <20MB base (from existing Story 1.8 spec)
- Support for 1000+ item lists

### Testing Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Location**: Colocated with source files (`.test.ts`)
- **Testing Framework**: Bun Test (Built-in)
- **Coverage Requirement**: >85% for TUI components
- **Performance Testing**: Tinybench integration for UI benchmarks
- **Visual Regression**: Use pixelmatch for terminal output comparison
- **TUI Testing**: node-pty for terminal emulation in tests
- **Snapshot Testing**: Bun Test Snapshots for TUI output validation

### Architecture Interface Requirements
The UIFramework must implement this interface from the original story specification:

```typescript
interface UIFramework {
  // Lifecycle
  initialize(): Promise<void>;
  render(): void;
  shutdown(): Promise<void>;

  // Screen Management  
  pushScreen(screen: Screen): void;
  popScreen(): void;
  replaceScreen(screen: Screen): void;

  // Event Handling
  on(event: string, handler: EventHandler): void;
  off(event: string, handler: EventHandler): void;

  // Component System
  registerComponent(name: string, component: Component): void;
  createComponent(name: string, props: any): ComponentInstance;
}

interface Screen {
  name: string;
  components: ComponentInstance[];
  onMount(): void;
  onUnmount(): void;
  onResize(width: number, height: number): void;
  handleInput(key: Key): void;
}
```

### Implementation Notes
- TUI spike (Story 1.4) appears to have selected Custom ANSI approach based on tech stack
- No specific TUI framework dependencies found, indicating custom implementation approach
- Must integrate with existing ServiceProvider DI container pattern
- Performance monitoring framework is operational and should be leveraged
- Pino logging infrastructure is complete and configured
