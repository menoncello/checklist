[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#Enhanced Lock File Schema]

#### Concurrency Patterns

- **Lock Directory**: `.checklist/.locks` for all lock files
- **Lock Timeout**: Default 5000ms with 100ms retry interval
- **Exclusive Creation**: Use file creation with O_EXCL flag for atomicity
- **Heartbeat System**: Automatic renewal before expiration
- **Stale Detection**: Check if lock PID still exists
  [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#Concurrency Manager]

#### Transaction Coordinator Pattern

```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id: string; // UUID
  startedAt: Date;
  operations: Operation[];
  snapshot: ChecklistState; // Pre-transaction state
  status: 'active' | 'committed' | 'rolled-back';
}
```

- **Snapshot Before Changes**: Always create state snapshot
- **Atomic Commits**: Validate all operations before applying
- **Rollback on Failure**: Restore from snapshot on error
  [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#Transaction Coordinator]

#### File Operations Standards

- **Use Bun APIs**: `Bun.file()` and `Bun.write()` for 10x performance
- **Atomic Writes**: Write to temp file, then rename for atomicity
- **Path Handling**: Use Node.js `path` module for cross-platform compatibility
- **Error Handling**: Always wrap file ops in try-catch with specific error types
  [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Bun-Specific Performance]

#### State Management Patterns

- **Immutable Updates**: Use spread operator for state modifications
- **Deep Copying**: Use `structuredClone()` for deep copies
- **Validation Required**: Always validate after loading state
- **Error Types**: Use `StateCorruptedError` for invalid states
  [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#State Management Standards]

#### Async Operation Standards

- **AbortController**: Required for all cancellable operations
- **Timeout Handling**: Set reasonable timeouts for file operations
- **Parallel Operations**: Use `Promise.all()` for concurrent ops
- **Error Context**: Include operation context in error messages
  [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Async Pattern Standards]

### File Locations for Implementation

- **Concurrency**: `packages/core/src/state/ConcurrencyManager.ts`
- **Transactions**: `packages/core/src/state/TransactionCoordinator.ts`
- **Backup Manager**: `packages/core/src/state/BackupManager.ts`

- **Errors**: `packages/core/src/state/errors.ts`

## Testing

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

1. **Test File Locations**:
   - Unit tests: `*.test.ts` colocated with source files
   - Integration tests: `*.spec.ts` in `__tests__` directories
   - All state tests in `packages/core/src/state/*.test.ts`

2. **State Testing Requirements**:
   - Use TestDataFactory for creating test workspaces
   - Create temporary `.checklist/` directories for testing
   - Always cleanup temp directories after tests
   - Mock file system operations where appropriate

3. **Performance Thresholds**:
   - State initialization: < 1000ms
   - State load/save: < 50ms
   - Lock acquisition: < 100ms
   - All operations must complete in < 10ms (excluding I/O)

4. **Concurrency Testing**:
   - Test with 100+ concurrent operations
   - Verify exclusive lock acquisition
   - Test timeout and retry mechanisms
   - Validate stale lock cleanup

5. **Coverage Requirements**:
   - Minimum 80% code coverage
   - 100% coverage for critical paths (lock, transaction, recovery)
   - Edge cases must be tested (corruption, conflicts, migrations)

### Test Scenarios to Cover

1. **Directory Creation**:
   - Fresh initialization
   - Existing directory handling
   - Permission errors
   - Cleanup on failure

2. **State Validation**:
   - Valid state files
   - Corrupted checksums
   - Invalid schema
   - Version migrations

3. **Concurrency**:
   - Exclusive lock acquisition
   - Lock timeout and retry
   - Stale lock cleanup
   - Multiple waiting processes

4. **Transactions**:
   - Successful commits
   - Rollback on error
   - Concurrent transactions
   - Snapshot integrity

5. **Recovery**:
   - Backup creation and rotation
   - Recovery from corruption
   - Data preservation
   - Recovery tracking

### NFR Assessment - 2025-09-05

**Quality Score: 80/100** (Security concerns require attention)

#### NFR Validation Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-05

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Outstanding implementation** with robust state management architecture. The implementation demonstrates excellent separation of concerns with dedicated managers for concurrency, transactions, backups, and security. All 15 acceptance criteria have been fully met with comprehensive test coverage (92.6% overall, 100% on critical paths). The recent QA fixes for security (secrets detection, field encryption, audit logging) and migration testing show strong responsiveness to quality feedback.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: packages/core/src/state/FieldEncryption.ts
  - **Change**: Added explicit authTagLength option to createDecipheriv

- Field-level encryption for sensitive data using AES-256-GCM
- Comprehensive security audit logging for all state operations
- Proper file permissions (0755 for dirs, 0644 for files)
- No security vulnerabilities identified

### Performance Considerations

**All performance targets achieved:**

- State initialization: < 1000ms ✓
- State load/save: < 50ms ✓
- Lock acquisition: < 100ms ✓
- Pure operations: < 10ms ✓
- Test suite execution: ~2 seconds for 138 tests
