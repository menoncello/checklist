### Technical Context
- Runtime: Bun 1.1.x with native performance optimizations
- Logger: Pino 9.x configured for high-performance JSON logging
- TUI: Custom ANSI framework requiring efficient rendering
- Build: Compiled with Bun for single executable output

### Key Performance Areas
- packages/core/src/index.ts - Main entry point
- packages/tui/src/index.ts - Terminal UI rendering
