# Story 1.14: Performance Tuning Optimization

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** optimized performance in critical code paths,  
**So that** the application meets the <100ms response time requirement consistently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Critical path operations execute in <100ms (95th percentile)
2. Memory usage optimized to prevent leaks in long-running sessions
3. TUI rendering maintains 60fps equivalent responsiveness
4. Existing Tinybench performance tests continue to pass
5. New performance optimizations follow existing code patterns
6. Integration with logger (Pino) maintains current behavior
7. Performance improvements covered by new benchmark tests
8. No regression in existing functionality verified
9. Performance metrics documented in reports/

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Performance Profiling and Analysis** (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Profile application with Chrome DevTools
  - [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks in critical paths
  - [ ] Analyze memory usage patterns
  - [ ] Document baseline performance metrics

- [ ] **Task 2: Optimize Core Operations** (AC: 1, 5)
  - [ ] Optimize hot paths in packages/core
  - [ ] Reduce unnecessary allocations
  - [ ] Implement caching where appropriate
  - [ ] Ensure <100ms response time

- [ ] **Task 3: TUI Rendering Optimization** (AC: 3, 5)
  - [ ] Optimize ANSI rendering pipeline
  - [ ] Implement efficient buffer management
  - [ ] Reduce re-renders and flicker
  - [ ] Maintain 60fps responsiveness

- [ ] **Task 4: Memory Management** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Fix identified memory leaks
  - [ ] Implement proper cleanup in long-running operations
  - [ ] Add memory monitoring utilities
  - [ ] Verify with profiling tools

- [ ] **Task 5: Performance Testing** (AC: 4, 7, 9)
  - [ ] Add new Tinybench performance tests
  - [ ] Ensure all existing tests pass
  - [ ] Create performance regression tests
  - [ ] Generate performance report in reports/performance/

- [ ] **Task 6: Integration Validation** (AC: 6, 8)
  - [ ] Verify Pino logger integration unchanged
  - [ ] Run full test suite
  - [ ] Validate no functional regressions
  - [ ] Update documentation if needed

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
- Performance tests must use Tinybench framework (v2.5.x)
- Tests should be placed in packages/*/tests/ directories
- Performance benchmarks should target <100ms requirement
- Use Chrome DevTools for profiling (built-in support)

### Technical Context
- Runtime: Bun 1.1.x with native performance optimizations
- Logger: Pino 9.x configured for high-performance JSON logging
- TUI: Custom ANSI framework requiring efficient rendering
- Build: Compiled with Bun for single executable output

### Key Performance Areas
- packages/core/src/index.ts - Main entry point
- packages/tui/src/index.ts - Terminal UI rendering
- packages/cli/src/index.ts - Command processing
- packages/core/src/utils/logger.ts - Pino logger factory
