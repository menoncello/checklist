# Story 1.8: Terminal Canvas System

## Overview

Establish the main user interface framework based on the TUI spike decision, creating the foundational UI architecture that all other interface components will build upon.

## Story Details

- **Epic**: 1 - Foundation & Core Architecture
- **Type**: Feature
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Estimated Effort**: 2 days
- **Dependencies**: [1.1, 1.2-decision, 1.3, 1.4]

## Description

Based on the outcome of the TUI spike (Story 1.2), implement the chosen UI framework and establish the core UI architecture. This includes setting up the main application loop, event handling, screen management, and the component system that will be used throughout the application.

## Acceptance Criteria

### If TUI Approach (Ink/Blessed/Custom):

- [ ] TUI framework integrated and configured
- [ ] Main application loop established
- [ ] Screen management system implemented
- [ ] Component hierarchy defined
- [ ] Keyboard event handling system
- [ ] Mouse event support (optional)
- [ ] Terminal capability detection
- [ ] Graceful degradation for unsupported terminals

### If CLI Approach (Fallback):

- [ ] Enhanced CLI interface architecture
- [ ] ANSI escape sequence management
- [ ] Manual screen buffer control
- [ ] Readline interface customization
- [ ] Terminal state management
- [ ] Clean exit handling

### Common Requirements:

- [ ] Error boundary implementation
- [ ] Crash recovery with state preservation
- [ ] Terminal resize handling
- [ ] Clean shutdown procedures
- [ ] Debug mode with verbose logging
- [ ] Performance monitoring hooks

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture

```typescript
interface UIFramework {
  // Lifecycle
  initialize(): Promise<void>;
  render(): void;
  shutdown(): Promise<void>;

  // Screen Management
  pushScreen(screen: Screen): void;
  popScreen(): void;
  replaceScreen(screen: Screen): void;

  // Event Handling
  on(event: string, handler: EventHandler): void;
  off(event: string, handler: EventHandler): void;

  // Component System
  registerComponent(name: string, component: Component): void;
  createComponent(name: string, props: any): ComponentInstance;
}

interface Screen {
  name: string;
  components: ComponentInstance[];
  onMount(): void;
  onUnmount(): void;
  onResize(width: number, height: number): void;
  handleInput(key: Key): void;
}
```

### Implementation Paths

#### Path A: TUI Framework Success

```typescript
// Using Ink (React-based)
class InkUIFramework implements UIFramework {
  private app: InkApp;
  private screens: Map<string, ReactComponent>;
  // Implementation...
}

// Using Blessed/Neo-blessed
class BlessedUIFramework implements UIFramework {
  private screen: BlessedScreen;
  private layouts: Map<string, BlessedBox>;
  // Implementation...
}
```

#### Path B: CLI Fallback

```typescript
// Custom ANSI-based UI
class ANSIUIFramework implements UIFramework {
  private buffer: ScreenBuffer;
  private readline: ReadlineInterface;
  // Implementation...
}
```

### Performance Requirements

- Application startup <50ms
- Screen transition <16ms
- Keyboard response <10ms
- Memory usage <20MB base
- Support for 1000+ item lists

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for UI framework core
- [ ] Integration tests for screen management
- [ ] Event handling tests
- [ ] Terminal compatibility tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Memory leak detection
- [ ] Crash recovery testing

## Risk Mitigation

- Implement abstraction layer for easy framework switching
- Keep UI logic separate from business logic
- Document all terminal-specific workarounds
- Maintain CLI fallback readiness

## Definition of Done

- [ ] UI framework fully integrated
- [ ] Main application loop stable
- [ ] Event handling responsive
- [ ] Screen management working
- [ ] Terminal compatibility verified
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Tests passing with >85% coverage
- [ ] Documentation complete
