## Dev Notes

### TUI Framework Decision (From Story 1.4 Results)

Based on the successful TUI spike (Story 1.4), the application will use a **Custom ANSI-based approach** with the following rationale:
- Startup time: 35ms (target: <50ms) ✅
- Render performance: 45ms for 1000 items (target: <100ms) ✅
- Memory usage: 18MB baseline (target: <20MB) ✅
- Cross-platform compatibility: Verified on macOS, Linux, Windows
- Bun compatibility: Full support confirmed
- Score: 82/100 (exceeds 75-point threshold for "PROCEED")

### Integration with Existing Architecture

**Dependencies on existing packages:**
- `packages/core`: Business logic and state management (Story 1.5, 1.6)
- `packages/shared`: Common utilities and types
- Pino logging infrastructure (Story 1.10) for debug output
- Performance monitoring framework (Story 1.7) for metrics
- IoC/Dependency injection (Story 1.13) for service resolution

**Key Integration Points:**
- TUI framework will consume workflow engine from `packages/core/src/workflow/`
- State updates will flow through existing state management in `packages/core/src/state/`
- Performance metrics will integrate with monitoring in `packages/core/src/performance/`
- Error handling will coordinate with core error boundaries

### Technical Architecture Details

**Main Framework Interface:**
```typescript
interface UIFramework {
  // Lifecycle management
  initialize(): Promise<void>;
  render(): void;
  shutdown(): Promise<void>;
  
  // Screen management
  pushScreen(screen: Screen): void;
  popScreen(): void;
  replaceScreen(screen: Screen): void;
  
  // Event handling
  on(event: string, handler: EventHandler): void;
  off(event: string, handler: EventHandler): void;
  
  // Component system
  registerComponent(name: string, component: Component): void;
  createComponent(name: string, props: any): ComponentInstance;
}
```

**Performance Requirements (from Architecture):**
- Application startup: <50ms (validated in spike: 35ms)
- Screen transition: <16ms
- Keyboard response: <10ms
- Memory baseline: <20MB (validated in spike: 18MB)
- Large list support: 1000+ items with smooth scrolling

**ANSI Rendering Strategy:**
Based on spike results, use direct ANSI escape sequences for:
- Screen clearing: `\x1b[2J\x1b[H`
- Cursor positioning: `\x1b[{row};{col}H`
- Color support: 256-color palette with fallback to 16-color
- Text styling: Bold, italic, underline with graceful degradation

**Security Considerations:**
- Input sanitization: Strip malicious ANSI escape sequences from user input
- Resource limits: Enforce maximum buffer sizes and rendering limits
- Terminal injection prevention: Validate all escape sequences before output
- Memory protection: Implement bounds checking for large lists and deep rendering

### Testing

**Testing Framework (from Story 1.3):**
- Unit tests using Bun's native test runner
- Integration tests with terminal emulation via node-pty
- Visual regression testing with pixelmatch for output comparison
- Performance benchmarks with tinybench
- Mutation testing with StrykerJS (Story 1.12)

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- Overall package: >85% coverage minimum
- Core framework classes: >90% coverage
- Critical path components: 100% coverage

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `packages/tui/src/**/*.test.ts` (co-located)
- Integration tests: `packages/tui/tests/integration/`
- Performance tests: `packages/tui/tests/performance/`
- Visual tests: `packages/tui/tests/visual/`

**Testing Patterns to Follow:**
- Mock terminal environment for unit tests
- Use test data factory for consistent test inputs
- Snapshot testing for terminal output validation
- Performance assertions for critical operations

**Edge Case Test Scenarios for Acceptance Criteria:**
- AC 5 (Keyboard handling): Test rapid key sequences, international characters, function keys
- AC 6 (Terminal capabilities): Test with minimal terminals (no color, limited ANSI support)
- AC 7 (Error boundaries): Test memory exhaustion, infinite loops, stack overflow recovery
- AC 8 (Resize handling): Test rapid resize events, extreme dimensions (1x1, 1000x1000)
- AC 9 (Clean shutdown): Test shutdown during active operations, corrupted state recovery
- AC 11-13 (Performance): Test with 10,000+ items, memory pressure, slow terminal output
