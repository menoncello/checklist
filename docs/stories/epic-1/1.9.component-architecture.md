# Story 1.9: Component Architecture

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a comprehensive view system that manages different application screens, layouts, and view states,
**so that** I can provide navigation between different parts of the application with consistent layout patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. View registry system for all application screens
2. Navigation stack with push/pop/replace operations
3. View state preservation during navigation
4. Layout system with consistent patterns:
   - Header (title, breadcrumbs)
   - Main content area
   - Footer (keybindings, status)
5. Modal/overlay support for dialogs
6. Split-pane view capability
7. Tab-based view switching
8. Keyboard shortcuts for view navigation
9. View transition animations (if TUI supports)
10. Responsive layout adjustment

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context (Story 1.8: Terminal Canvas System)

[Source: docs/stories/epic-1/story-1.8-terminal-canvas.md]
- TUI framework foundation completed with custom ANSI-based approach
- Screen management system already implemented in `packages/tui/src/screens/`
- Component hierarchy defined with BaseComponent and ComponentInstance
- Performance requirements validated: <50ms startup, <20MB memory baseline
- Error boundaries and crash recovery systems in place
- Keyboard event handling system with input sanitization operational
- Terminal capability detection working with graceful degradation

### Technical Architecture Context

**Core Components (from Components Architecture):**
[Source: docs/architecture/components.md]
- TUI Renderer component available for terminal UI rendering
- Component initialization order established: State Manager → Template Manager → TUI Renderer
- Component registry system pattern to follow for view registry

**Data Models for Views:**
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
```typescript
interface View {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  component: Component;
  onEnter(params?: any): void;
  onExit(): void;
  onFocus(): void;
  onBlur(): void;
  getState(): ViewState;
  setState(state: ViewState): void;
  layout?: LayoutConfig;
  keybindings?: KeyBinding[];
}
```

**File Structure Alignment:**
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- View system files should be created in `packages/tui/src/views/`
- Navigation logic in `packages/tui/src/navigation/`
- Layout components in `packages/tui/src/layouts/`
- Overlay/modal system in `packages/tui/src/overlays/`
- Transition system in `packages/tui/src/transitions/`

**Technology Stack:**
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Custom ANSI TUI framework (proven in Story 1.8)
- Bun native testing with coverage requirements
- TypeScript 5.9+ with strict typing
- Pino logging for debug output

**Performance Requirements:**
- View switching: <50ms (from architecture requirements)
- State save/restore: <10ms
- Layout change: <30ms
- Support 10+ concurrent views in memory

**Security Considerations:**
- Input sanitization: ANSI escape sequence filtering implemented in Story 1.8
- Resource limits: Enforce maximum buffer sizes and rendering limits
- Memory protection: Bounds checking for large lists and deep rendering

### Testing Standards

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `packages/tui/src/**/*.test.ts` (co-located with source files)
- Integration tests: `packages/tui/tests/integration/`
- Performance tests: `packages/tui/tests/performance/`

**Testing Framework:**
- Bun's native test runner with >85% coverage requirement
- Mutation testing with StrykerJS (configured in Story 1.12)
- Visual regression testing with pixelmatch for output validation
- Performance benchmarks with tinybench

**Testing Patterns:**
- Mock terminal environment for unit tests
- Test data factory for consistent test inputs (TestDataFactory pattern)
- Snapshot testing for terminal output validation
- Performance assertions for critical operations (<50ms view switching)

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- Overall TUI package: >85% coverage minimum
- Core view classes: >90% coverage
- Critical navigation paths: 100% coverage

### Coding Standards Compliance

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use TypeScript strict mode with no explicit `any` types
- Follow ESLint configuration with import organization
- Use Bun.file() for file operations (10x performance improvement)
- Implement proper resource management with Disposable pattern
- Use structured cloning for deep state copies: `structuredClone(state)`
- Follow Pino logging standards with child loggers for context

### Project Structure Notes

The view system aligns perfectly with the existing TUI package structure established in Story 1.8:
- Builds upon existing `packages/tui/src/screens/` foundation
- Extends `packages/tui/src/components/` component system
- Integrates with `packages/tui/src/framework/` TUI framework
- Leverages `packages/tui/src/events/` keyboard handling system
- Uses `packages/tui/src/performance/` monitoring for view transitions

No structural conflicts identified between epic requirements and existing architecture.
