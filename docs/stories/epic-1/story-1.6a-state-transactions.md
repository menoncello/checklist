# Story 1.6a: Write-Ahead Logging for State Recovery

> **Note**: This is an enhancement story (1.6a) that adds Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) to the existing transaction system for crash recovery and state consistency. The transaction coordinator and concurrency management already exist in the codebase.

## Status

**Done** ✅

> This is an enhancement story (1.6a) that extends Story 1.6 by adding Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) capabilities to the existing transaction system for crash recovery and state consistency

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** Write-Ahead Logging for state operations,  
**So that** checklist state can be recovered after crashes or failures.

## Priority

**P1 - Critical** 🔴

This enhancement adds crash recovery capability to the existing transaction system. Essential for production reliability before Story 2.1 (Checklist Panel).

## Time Estimate

**2-3 days** including comprehensive testing

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: Story 1.6 (Core Workflow Engine) must be complete - provides existing TransactionCoordinator and ConcurrencyManager to enhance
- **Blocks**: Story 2.1 (Checklist Panel) - WAL required for production reliability
- **Uses**: Existing StateManager from Story 1.5, existing TransactionCoordinator from Story 1.6
- **Updates**: Enhances existing TransactionCoordinator and WorkflowEngine from Story 1.6 with WAL capabilities

## Risk Factors

- 🟡 **Platform-specific file locking behavior** - May require OS-specific handling
- 🟡 **Performance overhead of WAL** - Must maintain <10ms write overhead
- 🟢 **Well-understood patterns** - WAL is proven technology from database systems

## Acceptance Criteria

### WAL Implementation

1. ✅ Implement write-ahead logging for state changes
2. ✅ WAL entries persist before state modifications
3. ✅ Automatic WAL replay on process startup after crash
4. ✅ WAL cleanup after successful transactions
5. ✅ Recovery mechanism for incomplete transactions

### Technical Requirements

- Maximum transaction time: 100ms
- Support for nested transactions
- Atomic rename operations for final commit
- Temporary `.checklist/.tmp/` directory for staging

### Performance Benchmarks

#### NEW Component (WAL) Performance Targets

| Operation | Target | Critical Threshold |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| WAL write | < 10ms | 20ms |
| WAL replay/recovery | < 100ms | 200ms |
| WAL clear after commit | < 5ms | 10ms |

#### EXISTING Component Performance (for reference)

| Operation | Target | Critical Threshold |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Lock acquisition | < 50ms | 100ms |
| State validation | < 20ms | 50ms |
| Atomic commit | < 30ms | 60ms |
| Transaction rollback | < 10ms | 20ms |
| Concurrent lock wait | < 100ms/attempt | 500ms |

### WAL Implementation Approach

```typescript
// This will be created in /packages/core/src/state/WriteAheadLog.ts
interface WALEntry {
  timestamp: number;
  op: 'write' | 'delete';
  key: string;
  value?: any;
  previousValue?: any;
}

class WriteAheadLog {
  private walPath = '.checklist/.wal';
  private entries: WALEntry[] = [];

  async append(entry: Omit<WALEntry, 'timestamp'>): Promise<void> {
    const fullEntry = { ...entry, timestamp: Date.now() };
    this.entries.push(fullEntry);

    // Append to WAL file
    await Bun.write(this.walPath, JSON.stringify(fullEntry) + '\n', { append: true });
  }

  async replay(): Promise<void> {
    if (!(await Bun.file(this.walPath).exists())) return;

    const content = await Bun.file(this.walPath).text();
    const lines = content.split('\n').filter(Boolean);

    for (const line of lines) {
      const entry = JSON.parse(line) as WALEntry;
      await this.applyEntry(entry);
    }
  }

  async clear(): Promise<void> {
    this.entries = [];
    await fs.unlink(this.walPath).catch(() => {});
  }
}
```

## Dev Notes

### Summary of What This Story Implements

**This story adds Write-Ahead Logging to the existing transaction system:**
- **NEW: WriteAheadLog** - WAL implementation for crash recovery
- **UPDATES: TransactionCoordinator** - Integrates WAL for durability
- **UPDATES: StateManager** - Adds WAL recovery on initialization
- **UPDATES: WorkflowEngine** - Adds recovery hooks in init()

**Existing components used (no changes needed):**
- ConcurrencyManager - Already provides file locking
- TransactionCoordinator - Already provides transaction coordination
- StateManager - Already provides state persistence

### Architecture Context

**Runtime & Dependencies** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Core Languages & Runtime]
- **Runtime**: Bun 1.1.x with built-in TypeScript support
- **State Format**: YAML using js-yaml 4.1.x for human-readable persistence
- **Schema Validation**: Ajv 8.12.x for YAML/JSON schema validation
- **File Operations**: Use Bun.write with built-in atomic operations
- **Process Management**: Bun.spawn for child process operations

### File Structure & Location [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#packages]

**Implementation Location**: `/packages/core/src/state/`
- `TransactionCoordinator.ts` - Main transaction coordinator class
- `WriteAheadLog.ts` - WAL implementation for crash recovery  
- `FileLock.ts` - Cross-platform file locking mechanism
- `StateTransaction.ts` - Transaction wrapper with validation

**Test Location**: `/packages/core/tests/state/`
- Unit tests colocated with source files (`.test.ts`)
- Integration tests for transaction scenarios

### Integration Patterns

**WAL Enhancement to Existing TransactionCoordinator**:
```typescript
// UPDATING existing TransactionCoordinator at /packages/core/src/state/TransactionCoordinator.ts
// This class already exists from Story 1.6 - we're adding WAL capabilities
export class TransactionCoordinator {
  private wal: WriteAheadLog; // NEW: Add WAL instance to existing class
  
  async addOperation(transactionId: string, type: string, path: string, data?: unknown): Promise<void> {
    // NEW: Write to WAL before existing operation logic
    await this.wal.append({ type, path, data });
    
    // Existing operation tracking continues...
  }
  
  async commitTransaction(transactionId: string): Promise<ChecklistState> {
    // Existing commit logic...
    
    // NEW: Clear WAL after successful commit
    await this.wal.clear();
  }
}
```

### Coding Standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**ESLint Rules to Follow**:
- `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`: warn (avoid any types)
- `@typescript-eslint/strict-boolean-expressions`: error (explicit boolean checks)
- `no-console`: warn (use debug logger instead)
- Use `Bun.env` instead of `process.env` for environment variables
- Maximum line width: 80 characters (Prettier)

### Error Handling Patterns [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy-complete-with-all-patterns.md]

**Circuit Breaker**: Implement circuit breaker for lock acquisition:
- Threshold: 5 failures before opening circuit
- Timeout: 60 seconds before retry
- Half-open state for gradual recovery

**Error Correlation**: Use ErrorCorrelator for detecting patterns:
- Detect repeated lock timeouts
- Identify error storms during high concurrency
- Generate smart recovery suggestions

### Testing Requirements [Source: architecture/testing-strategy-complete-with-all-testing-utilities.md]

**Test Utilities**:
- Use `TestDataFactory.createTestWorkspace()` for isolated test environments
- Implement `FlakyTestDetector` for concurrent access tests
- Required test coverage:
  - Critical paths (transaction operations): 95% minimum
  - File locking mechanisms: 90% minimum
  - WAL operations: 95% minimum
  - Recovery mechanisms: 100% required
  - Overall package coverage: 90% minimum

**Test Scenarios**:
1. Concurrent write attempts (use multiple Bun.spawn processes)
2. Crash recovery simulation (kill process mid-transaction)
3. Lock timeout and retry behavior
4. WAL replay after unexpected termination
5. State validation failures and rollback

### Performance Requirements

- Maximum transaction time: 100ms (from acceptance criteria)
- File operations must complete in <50ms [Source: architecture/backend-architecture]
- Use Bun's native file operations for performance
- Implement benchmarks using Tinybench 2.5.x [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Integration Notes

**WorkflowEngine Integration** (From Story 1.6):
- TransactionCoordinator already exists from Story 1.6 - this story enhances it with WAL
- WorkflowEngine from Story 1.6 will be updated to use the WAL-enhanced TransactionCoordinator
- Ensure compatibility with existing StateManager from Story 1.5
- Event emission for transaction state changes remains unchanged

### Security Considerations

- Lock files in `.checklist/.locks/` directory (not `.tmp/`)
- Use crypto.randomUUID() for lock IDs
- Validate all file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Never log sensitive state data

## Notes for Developers

- Use Bun's built-in file operations for better performance
- Consider using SQLite as future enhancement for complex transactions
- Ensure Windows compatibility with file locking
- Add telemetry for transaction performance monitoring

## Testing

### Test Standards and Requirements

**Test File Locations**: 
- Unit tests: `/packages/core/tests/state/*.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `/packages/core/tests/integration/transactions.test.ts`

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# Run all transaction tests
