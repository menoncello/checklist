# Story 1.15: Improve Mutation Testing Score

## Status
In Progress

## Story
**As a** quality engineer,  
**I want** improved mutation testing score above 90%,  
**So that** our test suite reliably catches potential bugs and regressions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Mutation score increased to >90% (from current 85% threshold)
2. Weak test assertions identified and strengthened
3. New test cases added to kill surviving mutants
4. Existing StrykerJS configuration (stryker.conf.js) continues to work
5. New tests follow existing testing patterns
6. Integration with Bun test runner maintains current behavior
7. All new assertions are meaningful (not just to kill mutants)
8. Test readability and maintainability preserved
9. Mutation report shows clear improvement in reports/mutation/

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.14 (Performance Tuning - COMPLETED):**
- Implemented TestDataFactory in packages/core/tests/test-utils/TestDataFactory.ts for fast test data generation with mocks
- Test utilities created but not all are present (CommandCache and FastTimers were planned but not found in codebase)
- Configured global 500ms timeout for all tests via bunfig.toml
- All unit tests optimized to <500ms using mock infrastructure
- Fixed performance test issues by using mock loggers instead of real I/O
- Removed console.log statements from tests that were causing output pollution
- Security utilities added: InputRateLimiter, PathSanitizer, ResourceLimits
[Source: Story 1.14 Dev Agent Record - Verified]

### Testing Standards
- Tests must be placed in packages/*/tests/ directories
- Use Bun test runner (built-in) with native assertions
- Follow existing test patterns and naming conventions
- Maintain test execution speed <100ms per test (500ms max per bunfig.toml)
- Use test doubles (mocks/stubs) to replace I/O operations
- Implement efficient test data factories for performance
- Enable parallel test execution where possible
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-test-performance-strategy]

### StrykerJS Configuration
**ACTUAL Current Configuration in stryker.conf.js:**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  packageManager: 'npm',  // Required for StrykerJS
  testRunner: 'command',   // Use command runner for Bun
  commandRunner: {
    // Run only unit tests, excluding integration tests
    command: 'STRYKER_MUTATOR_RUNNER=true bun test --test-name-pattern="^(?!.*Integration)"'
  },
  mutate: [
    'packages/*/src/**/*.ts',
    '!**/*.test.ts',
    '!**/*.spec.ts',
    '!**/*.d.ts',
    '!**/index.ts', // Often just re-exports
    '!**/~/**' // Exclude any tilde directories
  ],
  ignorePatterns: ['~/**', '.bun/**', 'node_modules/**/.git/**', '**/*.sock', '**/*.socket'],
  thresholds: {
    high: 95,
    low: 90,

  },
  plugins: ['@stryker-mutator/typescript-checker']
};
```
[Source: stryker.conf.js - Actual file in project root]

### Mutation Testing Workflow
1. **Initial Analysis**: Run StrykerJS to establish baseline (currently at 85% threshold)
2. **Gap Identification**: Review surviving mutants report in reports/mutation/index.html
3. **Test Enhancement**: Add tests targeting surviving mutants with meaningful assertions
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Track mutation score trends via dashboard reporter
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#mutation-testing-workflow]

### Mutation Score Requirements
- **Current Baseline**: Needs to be established by running mutation tests
- **Current Minimum Threshold**: 85% mutation score (configured in stryker.conf.js)
- **Target Goal**: >90% for this story (will update threshold.break to 90)
- **Critical Modules Target**: 95% for core package
- **CI Integration**: Automatic failure below threshold via stryker.conf.js
- **Incremental Testing**: Enabled by default with force mode for faster feedback
[Source: stryker.conf.js verified configuration]

### Test Optimization Utilities (Available from Story 1.14)
**Test Data Factory (packages/core/tests/test-utils/TestDataFactory.ts):** ✅ VERIFIED
- Located at packages/core/tests/test-utils/TestDataFactory.ts (not in utils/)
- Provides createMockLogger() for jest-style spy functions
- Provides createInMemoryLogger() for integration tests
- Provides createSilentLogger() for performance tests
[Source: Actual file verified in codebase]

**Note:** CommandCache and FastTimers utilities mentioned in Story 1.14 were not found in the codebase and were not implemented.

### Coding Standards for Tests
**ESLint Rules (Enforced):**
- No console.log in tests (use debug logger instead)
- No unused imports or variables
- Prefer const over let/var
- Use Bun.env instead of process.env
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#eslint-configuration-rules]

**Quality Checks (Must Pass):**
```bash
bun run lint          # ESLint check
bun run typecheck     # TypeScript type checking
bun run test          # Run all tests
bun run quality       # Run all quality checks
```

### Mutation Testing Strategy (Enhanced)
1. **Focus Areas for High Impact:**
   - Boundary conditions and edge cases (null, undefined, empty arrays)
   - Error handling paths (try-catch blocks, error callbacks)
   - Conditional branches (if-else, switch statements, ternary operators)
   - Loop conditions (for, while, array methods)
   - Type validations and guards
   - Async operation error cases
   
2. **Test Assertion Patterns to Kill Mutants:**
   - Use exact value assertions instead of truthy/falsy
   - Test both success and failure paths
   - Verify error messages and error types
   - Assert on all returned properties, not just existence
   - Test boundary values explicitly (0, -1, MAX_VALUE)
   - Verify state changes, not just final results

3. **Common Surviving Mutant Patterns:**
   - String literal mutations (fix: assert exact strings)
   - Boolean negations (fix: test both true/false cases)
   - Arithmetic operators (fix: test exact calculations)
   - Comparison operators (fix: test boundary values)
   - Array method mutations (fix: test empty/single/multiple items)
   - Optional chaining (fix: test null/undefined cases)

### Key Test Areas with Current Coverage
- packages/core/tests/ - Core business logic tests (target: 95% mutation score)
- packages/tui/tests/ - Terminal UI component tests (target: 90% mutation score)
- packages/cli/tests/ - Command-line interface tests (target: 90% mutation score)
- packages/shared/tests/ - Shared utility tests (target: 90% mutation score)

### Available Testing Tools
- **Bun Test**: Built-in test runner with native assertions
- **StrykerJS 9.1.x**: Mutation testing framework
- **Tinybench 5.0.x**: Micro-benchmarks for performance
- **Bun Coverage**: Built-in coverage reporting
- **node-pty 1.0.x**: Terminal emulation for TUI tests
- **pixelmatch 5.3.x**: Visual regression testing for terminal output
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#testing-suite]

### Performance Considerations
- All unit tests must execute in <500ms (enforced via bunfig.toml)
- Use mocks to avoid I/O operations in unit tests
- Leverage test factories for efficient test data generation
- Run mutation testing with concurrency: 4 for faster feedback
- Use incremental mode to only test changed files

## QA Results

### Gate Decision: CONCERNS
**Date:** 2025-09-12  
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor)  
**Confidence Level:** 75%

### Summary
Story 1.15 demonstrates significant progress in improving mutation testing infrastructure and test coverage, achieving dramatic improvements in critical modules (MetricsCollector: +78.73%, MemoryTracker: +59.65%). However, the primary acceptance criterion of >90% overall mutation score has not been met (current ~69%). The story delivers substantial value through infrastructure fixes and quality improvements but requires additional work to achieve stated objectives.

### Acceptance Criteria Status
- ✅ **AC2**: Weak test assertions identified and strengthened
- ✅ **AC3**: New test cases added to kill surviving mutants (76 new tests)
- ✅ **AC4**: StrykerJS configuration works (with necessary modifications)
- ✅ **AC5**: New tests follow existing patterns
- ✅ **AC6**: Bun test runner integration maintained
- ✅ **AC7**: Meaningful assertions (not just mutation killers)
- ✅ **AC8**: Test readability and maintainability preserved
- ⚠️ **AC1**: Mutation score >90% NOT ACHIEVED (current ~69%)
- ⚠️ **AC9**: Full mutation report generation incomplete

### Key Achievements
1. **Infrastructure Fix**: Resolved critical Stryker/Bun compatibility blocking issue
2. **Coverage Improvements**: 138.38 percentage points total improvement across 2 modules
3. **Test Quality**: Comprehensive test suites with edge cases, error handling, event systems
4. **Technical Solutions**: Custom test wrapper script enables mutation testing with Bun

### Critical Gaps
1. **Primary Goal**: Need ~21% additional improvement to reach 90% target
2. **Low Coverage Modules**: 6 modules still below 30% coverage
3. **Performance Issues**: Mutation testing timeouts prevent full runs
4. **Technical Debt**: TypeScript checking disabled in Stryker

### Required Actions for Story Completion
1. [ ] Achieve >90% overall mutation score (PRIMARY)
2. [ ] Complete full mutation testing run without timeouts
3. [x] Address at least 3 more low-coverage modules:
   - [x] CrashRecovery.ts (5.41% → 86.98%)
   - [ ] ErrorBoundary.ts (10.54%)
   - [ ] StatePreservation.ts (7.14%)
4. [ ] Document final mutation scores for all packages
5. [ ] Re-enable TypeScript checking with proper mock typing

### Risk Assessment
- **HIGH**: Story incomplete without meeting primary AC (>90% score)
- **MEDIUM**: Mutation testing performance may block CI/CD
- **MEDIUM**: Disabled TypeScript checking may hide type issues
- **LOW**: Test wrapper script adds infrastructure complexity

### Recommendations
1. **Continue Development**: Story has significant remaining work
2. **Focus on Critical Modules**: Prioritize error handling and event system modules
3. **Performance Optimization**: Investigate mutation testing timeout issues
4. **Consider Scope Adjustment**: If 90% proves unrealistic, document rationale for adjusted target

### Quality Gate File
Full assessment available at: `docs/qa/gates/epic-1.story-1.15-improve-mutation-score.yml`

**Gate Decision Rationale:** CONCERNS status reflects excellent progress with critical gaps. The infrastructure fixes and coverage improvements provide significant value, but the primary acceptance criterion remains unmet. Additional focused effort required to achieve the stated >90% mutation score objective.
