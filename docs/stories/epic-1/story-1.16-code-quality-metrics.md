# Story 1.16: Code Quality Metrics Enforcement

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** technical lead,  
**I want** automated code quality metrics enforcement,  
**So that** the codebase maintains high standards of readability, maintainability, and simplicity.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. File size limits enforced (max 300 lines per file)
2. Method/function size limits enforced (max 30 lines per function)
3. Cyclomatic complexity limits enforced (max complexity of 10)
4. Maximum indentation depth enforced (max 3 levels)
5. Quality metrics integrated into ESLint configuration
6. CI/CD pipeline fails when quality thresholds are exceeded
7. Detailed quality reports generated for each violation
8. Existing code refactored to meet new quality standards
9. Pre-commit hooks validate quality metrics locally

  - [ ] Add complexity analysis to hook
  - [ ] Ensure fast execution (<5 seconds)

- [ ] **Task 8: Integrate with CI/CD** (AC: 6, 7)
  - [ ] Update GitHub Actions workflow
  - [ ] Add quality metrics step
  - [ ] Configure failure on threshold breach
  - [ ] Generate and store quality reports as artifacts

- [ ] **Task 9: Documentation and Training** (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Update docs/architecture/coding-standards.md
  - [ ] Document quality thresholds and rationale
  - [ ] Create refactoring guidelines
  - [ ] Add examples of good vs bad patterns

## Dev Notes

### Quality Metrics Configuration

**File Size Limits:**
- Maximum lines per file: 300
- Excludes comments and blank lines
- Test files may have relaxed limits (450 lines)

**Function Size Limits:**
- Maximum lines per function: 30
- Includes function body only
- Complex algorithms may be exempted with eslint-disable comment

**Cyclomatic Complexity:**
- Maximum complexity: 10
- Measures independent paths through code
- Switch statements count as single decision point

**Indentation Depth:**
- Maximum nesting: 3 levels
- Encourages early returns and guard clauses
- Promotes extraction of nested logic

### ESLint Rules Configuration
```javascript
// eslint.config.js additions
{
  rules: {
    'max-lines': ['error', { max: 300, skipBlankLines: true, skipComments: true }],
    'max-lines-per-function': ['error', { max: 30, skipBlankLines: true, skipComments: true }],
    'complexity': ['error', { max: 10 }],
    'max-depth': ['error', { max: 3 }],
    'max-nested-callbacks': ['error', { max: 3 }],
    'max-params': ['error', { max: 4 }]
  }
}
```

### Refactoring Strategies

1. **Large Files:**
   - Extract related functions to separate modules
   - Create sub-modules for logical groupings
   - Use barrel exports for clean imports

2. **Long Functions:**
   - Extract helper functions
   - Use function composition
   - Apply single responsibility principle

3. **High Complexity:**
   - Replace nested conditionals with guard clauses
   - Use lookup tables instead of switch statements
   - Extract complex conditions to named functions

4. **Deep Nesting:**
   - Use early returns
   - Flatten promise chains with async/await
   - Extract nested loops to separate functions

### Quality Reports Location
- ESLint reports: reports/quality/eslint/
- Complexity reports: reports/quality/complexity/
- Baseline metrics: reports/quality/baseline.json
- Trend analysis: reports/quality/trends/

### Exemptions Process
- Document exemptions in code with clear rationale
- Require team review for exemptions
- Track exemptions in reports/quality/exemptions.md
