# Story 1.2: CI/CD Pipeline Foundation

## Status

**Draft**

## Story

**As a** development team,  
**I want** automated testing and deployment pipelines from the start,  
**so that** all code is continuously validated and releases are automated.

## Priority

**HIGH** - Must be established before significant development begins

## Acceptance Criteria

### GitHub Actions Setup

1. Main workflow file created (`.github/workflows/main.yml`)
2. PR validation workflow running on all pull requests
3. Branch protection rules enforced on main
4. All checks must pass before merge
5. Automated security scanning enabled

### Test Automation

1. Unit tests run on every push
2. TypeScript compilation verified
3. Linting and formatting checks enforced
4. Test coverage reports generated (target: >80%)
5. Performance benchmarks executed

### Build Pipeline

1. Bun binary compilation tested
2. Multi-platform builds (macOS, Linux, Windows)
3. Binary size validation (<20MB)
4. Artifact storage configured
5. Build caching optimized

### Release Automation

1. Semantic versioning enforced
2. Changelog generation automated
3. GitHub Releases created automatically
4. Binary assets attached to releases
5. npm package publishing prepared

### Third-Party Integration Setup

1. System clipboard integration configured
2. Terminal API compatibility tested (ANSI escape codes)
3. Cross-platform file system operations validated
4. Git integration setup and tested
5. External service authentication scaffolding

## Technical Implementation

### Main Workflow Configuration

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      - run: bun install
      - run: bun test
      - run: bun run typecheck
      - run: bun run lint

  build:
    needs: test
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      - run: bun install
      - run: bun build --compile --target=native
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: binary-${{ matrix.os }}
          path: ./dist/checklist

  performance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      - run: bun install
      - run: bun run bench
      - run: bun run bench:assert
```

### Release Workflow

```yaml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      - run: bun install
      - run: bun run build:all
      - uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        with:
          files: |
            dist/checklist-macos
            dist/checklist-linux
            dist/checklist-windows.exe
      - run: npm publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.1 established monorepo structure with 4 packages (core, cli, tui, shared)
- TypeScript strict mode configured with all checks enabled
- ESLint/Prettier already configured with pre-commit hooks via Husky
- Performance budgets defined: 50ms startup, 30MB memory, 10ms operations, 20MB binary
- Bun.env preferred over process.env per coding standards
- Test structure already initialized in packages/*/tests/ directories

### CI/CD Technology Stack
**GitHub Actions** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Build & Distribution]
- Version: latest
- Purpose: Multi-platform builds, automated testing and releases
- Rationale: Native GitHub integration, free for public repos

### Testing Requirements
**Test Suite Configuration** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy-complete-with-all-testing-utilities.md]
- Unit Testing: Bun Test (built-in)
- Mutation Testing: StrykerJS 8.2.x for test quality validation
- Coverage Tool: Bun Coverage (built-in) with >80% target
- Performance Testing: Tinybench 2.5.x for <100ms validation
- Visual Regression: pixelmatch 5.3.x for terminal output comparison
- Security Scanning: npm audit (built-in), Semgrep 1.45.x for static analysis

### Build Requirements
**Binary Compilation** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Build & Distribution]
- Compiler: Bun 1.1.x native compilation
- Target: Single executable output
- Size Limit: <20MB per architecture/performance-complete-implementation.md
- Platforms: macOS (x64, arm64), Linux (x64), Windows (x64)

### Development Workflow Integration
**CI Commands** [Source: architecture/development-workflow-enhanced-with-all-improvements.md#Cross-Platform CI]
- Test matrix: ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest
- Bun versions: 1.1.x, latest
- Required environment variables: NPM_TOKEN for publishing

### Security Requirements
**Security Scanning** [Source: architecture/security-and-performance-complete-implementation.md]
- Dependency audit on every PR
- Semgrep security patterns scan
- Secret detection in commits

### File Locations
- Workflows: `.github/workflows/`
- Benchmark scripts: `packages/core/tests/benchmarks/`
- Performance baselines: `.performance/baselines/`

### Technical Constraints
- GitHub Actions has 2000 minutes/month free tier limit
- Windows builds typically 2-3x slower than Linux
- Bun binary compilation requires native OS for target platform
- npm publishing requires 2FA token configuration

## Time Estimate

**8-12 hours** for complete pipeline setup

## Dependencies

- Story 1.0 (Database/State Store Setup) - Complete ✅
- Story 1.1 (Project Setup and Structure) - Complete ✅
- Blocks all other development stories (quality gate)

## Notes

- Use Bun's native compilation for binaries
- Consider GitHub Actions cache for dependencies
- Monitor GitHub Actions usage/billing (2000 minutes free tier)
- Set up status badges in README
- Configure Dependabot for dependency updates
- Windows builds may be slower, consider timeout adjustments
- npm publishing will initially use dry-run mode until tokens configured

## Project Structure Notes

- Workflows follow standard GitHub Actions structure in `.github/workflows/`
- Benchmark results stored in `.performance/` (gitignored but cached in CI)
- Coverage reports in `coverage/` directory per standard conventions
- All third-party integrations in shared package for reusability
