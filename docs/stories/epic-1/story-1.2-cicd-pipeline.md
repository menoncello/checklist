# Story 1.2: CI/CD Pipeline Foundation

## Story

**As a** development team,  
**I want** automated testing and deployment pipelines from the start,  
**so that** all code is continuously validated and releases are automated.

## Priority

**HIGH** - Must be established before significant development begins

## Acceptance Criteria

### GitHub Actions Setup

1. ✅ Main workflow file created (`.github/workflows/main.yml`)
2. ✅ PR validation workflow running on all pull requests
3. ✅ Branch protection rules enforced on main
4. ✅ All checks must pass before merge
5. ✅ Automated security scanning enabled

### Test Automation

1. ✅ Unit tests run on every push
2. ✅ TypeScript compilation verified
3. ✅ Linting and formatting checks enforced
4. ✅ Test coverage reports generated (target: >80%)
5. ✅ Performance benchmarks executed

### Build Pipeline

1. ✅ Bun binary compilation tested
2. ✅ Multi-platform builds (macOS, Linux, Windows)
3. ✅ Binary size validation (<20MB)
4. ✅ Artifact storage configured
5. ✅ Build caching optimized

### Release Automation

1. ✅ Semantic versioning enforced
2. ✅ Changelog generation automated
3. ✅ GitHub Releases created automatically
4. ✅ Binary assets attached to releases
5. ✅ npm package publishing prepared

### Third-Party Integration Setup

1. ✅ System clipboard integration configured
2. ✅ Terminal API compatibility tested (ANSI escape codes)
3. ✅ Cross-platform file system operations validated
4. ✅ Git integration setup and tested
5. ✅ External service authentication scaffolding

## Technical Implementation

### Main Workflow Configuration

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      - run: bun install
      - run: bun test
      - run: bun run typecheck
      - run: bun run lint

  build:
    needs: test
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      - run: bun install
      - run: bun build --compile --target=native
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: binary-${{ matrix.os }}
          path: ./dist/checklist

  performance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      - run: bun install
      - run: bun run bench
      - run: bun run bench:assert
```

### Release Workflow

```yaml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      - run: bun install
      - run: bun run build:all
      - uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        with:
          files: |
            dist/checklist-macos
            dist/checklist-linux
            dist/checklist-windows.exe
      - run: npm publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

## Development Tasks

### CI/CD Pipeline

- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/` directory structure
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules in GitHub settings
- [ ] Set up required secrets (NPM_TOKEN, etc.)
- [ ] Create build scripts in package.json
- [ ] Implement performance benchmark suite
- [ ] Set up code coverage reporting
- [ ] Configure dependency caching
- [ ] Test multi-platform builds
- [ ] Validate binary compilation
- [ ] Document CI/CD processes

### Third-Party Integration Setup

- [ ] Implement cross-platform clipboard access utilities
- [ ] Create terminal capability detection system
- [ ] Set up Git repository integration (status, commit detection)
- [ ] Add file system watch utilities for state changes
- [ ] Configure environment detection (CI, terminal type, OS)
- [ ] Create fallback mechanisms for limited environments
- [ ] Test integration across all target platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- [ ] Document third-party dependency requirements

## Definition of Done

### CI/CD Requirements

- [ ] All workflows passing on main branch
- [ ] Pull request checks enforced
- [ ] Test coverage >80%
- [ ] Performance benchmarks baselined
- [ ] Binary builds under 20MB
- [ ] Release process documented
- [ ] Team can trigger releases via tags

### Third-Party Integration Requirements

- [ ] Clipboard integration tested on all platforms
- [ ] Terminal compatibility verified across emulators
- [ ] Git operations working in diverse repository states
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms functional in limited environments
- [ ] Cross-platform file operations validated
- [ ] External service error handling implemented

## Time Estimate

**8-12 hours** for complete pipeline setup

## Dependencies

- Story 1.1 must be complete (project structure)
- Blocks all other development (quality gate)

## Notes

- Use Bun's native compilation for binaries
- Consider GitHub Actions cache for dependencies
- Monitor GitHub Actions usage/billing
- Set up status badges in README
- Configure Dependabot for dependency updates
