**Done**

## Story

**As a** development team,  
**I want** a comprehensive testing framework established early in the project,  
**so that** we can practice TDD and ensure quality from the first commit.

## Priority

## Acceptance Criteria

### Testing Infrastructure

1. ✅ Unit test framework configured (Bun test/Jest)
2. ✅ Integration test setup complete
3. ✅ Terminal output snapshot testing
4. ✅ Coverage reporting >80%
5. ✅ Test runner configuration

### Test Categories

1. ✅ Mock system for external dependencies
2. ✅ Test data fixtures
3. ✅ Pre-commit hooks for tests
4. ✅ Performance benchmark tests
5. ✅ Accessibility testing for TUI components

### CI Integration

1. ✅ CI/CD integration
2. ✅ Test documentation
3. ✅ Screen reader compatibility tests
4. ✅ Keyboard navigation tests

  // Test Types - aligned with tech-stack.md
  unit: BunTestRunner;           // Bun Test (Built-in)
  integration: IntegrationTestRunner;
  mutation: StrykerJSRunner;     // StrykerJS 8.2.x for test quality
  snapshot: BunSnapshotRunner;   // Bun Test Snapshots (Built-in)
  performance: TinybenchRunner;  // Tinybench 2.5.x for micro-benchmarks
  visual: VisualRegressionTester; // pixelmatch 5.3.x

  // Coverage - using Bun's built-in coverage
  coverage: BunCoverageReporter;

  // Utilities aligned with architecture
  mocks: MockSystem;
  fixtures: TestDataFactory;      // From testing-strategy.md
  helpers: TestHelpers;
  flakyDetector: FlakyTestDetector; // From testing-strategy.md
}

### Unit Test Example (Architecture Aligned)

```typescript
// packages/core/tests/template-parser.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from 'bun:test';
import { TestDataFactory } from '@checklist/shared/testing';
import type { ChecklistTemplate } from '@checklist/shared/types';
import { TemplateParser } from '../src/template-parser';

// Using TestDataFactory from testing-strategy.md
const testFactory = new TestDataFactory();

describe('TemplateParser', () => {
  let parser: TemplateParser;

  beforeEach(() => {
    parser = new TemplateParser();
  });

  it('should parse valid YAML template', async () => {
    // Use TestDataFactory for consistent test data
    const template = testFactory.createTemplate({
      id: 'test-template',
      name: 'Valid Template',
      steps: [
        { id: 'step-1', title: 'First Step', required: true },
        { id: 'step-2', title: 'Second Step', required: false },
      ],
    });

    const yaml = testFactory.templateToYaml(template);
    const result = await parser.parse(yaml);
    
    expect(result.template.id).toBe('test-template');
    expect(result.errors).toHaveLength(0);
    expect(result.template.steps).toHaveLength(2);
  });

  it('should handle circular dependencies', async () => {
    // Test circular dependency detection
    const circularYaml = testFactory.createCircularTemplate();
    
    await expect(parser.parse(circularYaml))
      .rejects
      .toThrow('Circular dependency detected');
  });

  it('should validate against schema', async () => {
    // Test schema validation using Ajv (from tech-stack.md)
    const invalidTemplate = testFactory.createTemplate({
      id: '', // Invalid: empty ID
      name: 'Invalid Template',
    });

    const yaml = testFactory.templateToYaml(invalidTemplate);
    const result = await parser.parse(yaml);
    
    expect(result.errors).toContain('Template ID cannot be empty');
    expect(result.template).toBeNull();
  });
});
```

### Terminal Snapshot Testing (Bun Native)

```typescript
// packages/cli/tests/cli-output.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from 'bun:test';
import { spawn } from 'bun';
import { stripAnsi } from '@checklist/shared/utils';

describe('CLI Output', () => {
  it('should display help correctly', async () => {
    // Use Bun.spawn for process execution (per coding-standards.md)
    const proc = spawn(['bun', 'run', 'cli', '--help'], {
      stdout: 'pipe',
      stderr: 'pipe',
    });

    const output = await new Response(proc.stdout).text();
    
    // Use Bun's built-in snapshot testing
    expect(output).toMatchSnapshot('help-output.txt');
  });

  it('should show progress bar with correct formatting', async () => {
    const { ProgressRenderer } = await import('../src/progress-renderer');
    const renderer = new ProgressRenderer({ width: 80 });
    
    const output = renderer.render({
      current: 5,
      total: 12,
      percentage: 45,
      message: 'Processing tasks...',
    });

    // Strip ANSI for consistent snapshots across terminals
    const cleanOutput = stripAnsi(output);
    
    expect(cleanOutput).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
      "[███████████           ] 45% (5/12) Processing tasks..."
    `);
  });

  it('should handle terminal resize gracefully', async () => {
    const { ProgressRenderer } = await import('../src/progress-renderer');
    const renderer = new ProgressRenderer({ width: 40 }); // Narrow terminal
    
    const output = renderer.render({
      current: 8,
      total: 10,
      percentage: 80,
      message: 'Almost done',
    });

    expect(stripAnsi(output)).toContain('80%');
    expect(stripAnsi(output)).toContain('(8/10)');
  });
});
```
