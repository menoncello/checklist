# Story 1.5: State Management Implementation

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** a robust YAML-based state management system,  
**so that** workflow progress persists between sessions and is human-readable.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. State manager creates `.checklist/` directory structure automatically
2. YAML state files with schema: `state.yaml`, `config.yaml`, `history.yaml`
3. Atomic writes using temp file + rename strategy
4. Automatic backup before modifications in `.checklist/.backup/`
5. State corruption detection using checksums
6. JSON Schema validation ensures integrity
7. File locking prevents concurrent modification
8. Migration system for state file version updates
9. All operations complete in <50ms

  checksum: string;
  lastModified: Date;
  activeInstance?: {
    id: string;

### Architecture Patterns
- **Base Service Pattern**: Extend BaseService class with proper lifecycle methods [Source: architecture/backend-architecture-complete-with-all-services.md#BaseService]
- **Dependency Injection**: Use Container for service dependencies [Source: architecture/backend-architecture-complete-with-all-services.md#Container]
- **Concurrency Control**: Implement using ConcurrencyManager patterns [Source: architecture/backend-architecture-complete-with-all-services.md#ConcurrencyManager]

### State File Paths
- **Main State**: `.checklist/state.yaml`
- **Config**: `.checklist/config.yaml`
- **History**: `.checklist/history.yaml`
- **Backups**: `.checklist/.backup/state.yaml.{timestamp}`
- **Lock Files**: `.checklist/.locks/{resource}.lock`

### Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode with all ESLint rules enforced [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Follow Prettier formatting with 80 character line limit [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use Bun.env instead of process.env for environment variables [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Avoid console.log - use debug logger instead [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Testing Requirements
- **Test Framework**: Bun Test (built-in test runner) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Test Data Factory**: Use TestDataFactory.createTestWorkspace() for isolated test environments [Source: architecture/testing-strategy-complete-with-all-testing-utilities.md#TestDataFactory]
- **Coverage Target**: 100% test coverage required [Source: Epic AC]
- **Performance Testing**: Use Tinybench for <50ms validation [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Test Location**: Tests colocated with source as `.test.ts` files [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
