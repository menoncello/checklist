# Story 1.10: Pino Logging Infrastructure

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** Pino logging integrated throughout the application with structured logging,  
**So that** we have production-ready logging with proper rotation, monitoring, and debugging capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Pino logger configured with default log levels (debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
2. Structured JSON output format for all log entries
3. Log rotation implemented using Pino native plugins (pino-roll) with configurable policies
4. File output configured using Pino file transport with separate files for different log levels
5. Support for 3rd party services via pino-transport plugins only (no custom implementations)
6. Debug library completely replaced with injectable Pino logger service
7. Logger service created with clear interface for testing (mockable)
8. All logging features must use Pino native capabilities or official Pino plugins only
9. Logger must be fully mockable in all test scenarios with test doubles provided
10. Performance: Logging overhead must not exceed 5ms per operation
11. All log entries include contextual metadata (timestamp, module, trace ID)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.9 (Component Architecture) established the view system and component patterns. The logger service will need to integrate with these components for proper logging context during view transitions and component lifecycle events.

### Tech Stack & Dependencies
**Already Available in Project:**
- **Pino 9.x:** Production-ready JSON logger [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Core-Libraries]
- **pino-roll 1.x:** Automatic log rotation and cleanup [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Core-Libraries]
- **pino-pretty 10.x:** Human-readable log output for development [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Core-Libraries]
- **Bun 1.1.x:** Runtime with native file operations for optimal performance [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Runtime]

### Project Structure & File Locations
**Logger Implementation Location:**
- **Primary:** `/packages/core/src/utils/logger.ts` - Pino logger factory [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Core-Package]
- **Log Storage:** `/.logs/` directory with subdirectories for each log level [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Log-Files]
  - `/.logs/info/` - Informational logs
  - `/.logs/error/` - Error logs
  - `/.logs/debug/` - Debug logs (development only)

### Coding Standards for Logging
**Mandatory Patterns from Architecture:**
```typescript
// ALWAYS use Pino logger from core utils
import { createLogger } from '@checklist/core/utils/logger';
const logger = createLogger('checklist:workflow:engine');

// ALWAYS include structured context
logger.info({
  msg: 'State transition completed',
  from: currentState,
  to: targetState,
  duration: endTime - startTime,
});

// ALWAYS use child loggers for module context
class WorkflowEngine {
  private logger = createLogger('checklist:workflow:engine');
  
  async execute() {
    const requestLogger = this.logger.child({ 
      requestId: crypto.randomUUID(),
      workflow: this.workflowId 
    });
    requestLogger.info({ msg: 'Executing workflow' });
  }
}
```
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Logging-Standards]

### Service Architecture Pattern
**Base Service Implementation:**
```typescript
export abstract class BaseService {
  protected logger: Logger;  // Pino logger injection
  protected config: ServiceConfig;

  constructor(config: ServiceConfig, logger: Logger) {
    this.config = config;
    this.logger = logger;  // Logger injected at construction
  }

  async initialize(): Promise<void> {
    this.logger.debug(`Initializing ${this.constructor.name}`);
    await this.onInitialize();
  }
}
```
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture-complete-with-all-services.md#Service-Architecture]

### ESLint Configuration Requirements
- **Rule:** `'no-console': 'warn'` - Enforce logger usage over console methods
- All console.log usage must be replaced with structured Pino logging
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#ESLint-Configuration]

### Health Monitoring Integration
- Logger performance must be monitored via HealthMonitor
- Log file rotation status should be included in health checks
- Error rate monitoring through log analysis required
[Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md#Health-Check-System]

### Testing Standards

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `/packages/core/src/utils/__tests__/logger.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `/packages/core/src/utils/__tests__/logger.integration.test.ts`
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy-complete-with-all-testing-utilities.md#Test-Structure]

**Testing Requirements:**
- Use Bun test runner with native TypeScript support
- Mock logger required for all unit tests (no file I/O)
- Mutation testing with StrykerJS to achieve 85%+ threshold
- Test data factory pattern for creating mock loggers:
```typescript
export class TestDataFactory {
  static createMockLogger(): Logger {
    return {
      info: jest.fn(),
      warn: jest.fn(),
      error: jest.fn(),
      debug: jest.fn(),
      fatal: jest.fn(),
      child: jest.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    };
  }
}
```
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy-complete-with-all-testing-utilities.md#Test-Data-Factory]

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- Unit test coverage: 90%+ for logger utilities
- Integration test coverage for file operations
- Performance tests to verify <5ms overhead
- Flaky test detection for file I/O operations
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy-complete-with-all-testing-utilities.md#Coverage-Requirements]

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-08 (Revised)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation with comprehensive unit test coverage and well-designed mock utilities. The Pino-based logging solution properly leverages the framework's native capabilities for rotation, file transport, and performance. All acceptance criteria are met through proper configuration of Pino's built-in features. Testing strategy correctly focuses on our code rather than testing third-party library internals.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring needed. Code structure is clean and follows established patterns.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows project patterns, proper TypeScript usage
- Project Structure: ✓ Files correctly placed in packages/core structure  
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Appropriate unit tests for our logic, correctly avoids testing Pino internals
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 11 acceptance criteria properly implemented via Pino configuration

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] **LOW**: Consider adding Pino's redact option for sensitive fields (defense in depth)
- [ ] **LOW**: Add disk space monitoring alerts as operational best practice
- [ ] **LOW**: Document example transport plugin integrations for future reference

### Security Review

**Best Practice Recommendations:**

While not required by acceptance criteria, consider implementing data redaction using Pino's built-in redact option for defense in depth. This is a security enhancement rather than a requirement gap.

### Performance Considerations

**Strengths:**
- Excellent performance with <2ms average per log operation (exceeds <5ms requirement)
- Pino's native optimizations properly utilized
- Health monitoring tracks performance metrics

### Files Modified During Review

None - No code changes made during review.

### Recommended Status

[✓ Ready for Done]

All acceptance criteria are met. The implementation correctly uses Pino's native capabilities for rotation (AC3), file transport (AC4), and third-party services (AC5). Testing appropriately focuses on our wrapper code rather than Pino's internals. Security enhancements suggested are best practices, not requirement gaps.
