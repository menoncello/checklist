## 👥 Team Allocation (Optimal)

### 3 Developers Available:
- **Dev 1**: 1.2 (TUI Spike) → 1.5 (Canvas)
- **Dev 2**: 1.1 + 1.3 + 1.4 (Foundation stories)  
- **Dev 3**: 1.14 + 1.15 + 1.16 (Quality stories)

### 2 Developers Available:
- **Dev 1**: 1.2 → 1.5 → 1.6 (TUI chain)
- **Dev 2**: 1.1 → 1.3 → 1.4 → Quality stories

### 1 Developer:
- **Priority Order**: 1.2 → 1.1 → 1.3 → 1.4 → 1.5 → 1.6 → Quality stories

---

## ⚡ Quick Rules

1. **No conflicts between**:
   - Quality stories (1.14, 1.15, 1.16)
   - Foundation stories (1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.13)
   - TUI spike (1.2) and everything except 1.5, 1.6

2. **Must complete first**:
   - 1.2 before starting 1.5 or 1.6

3. **Can merge in any order**:
   - All Group 1 stories
   - Quality improvements don't block features

---

## 📅 Suggested Sprint Plan

### Sprint 1 (Week 1-2):
- Start all Group 1 stories in parallel
- Focus on completing 1.2 quickly to unblock 1.5 and 1.6

### Sprint 2 (Week 3-4):  
- Complete Group 1 stories
- Start 1.5 and 1.6 after 1.2 is done
- Move to Epic 2 stories

---

## 🎯 Priority Levels

### Critical Path (Do First):
- 1.2 - TUI Technology Spike (unblocks others)

### High Priority:
- 1.1 - Project Setup (foundation)
- 1.3 - Core Workflow Engine (core feature)
- 1.4 - State Management (core feature)

### Medium Priority:
- 1.5 - Terminal Canvas (after 1.2)
- 1.6 - Components (after 1.2)
- 1.13 - IoC Pattern

### Low Priority (Can defer):
- 1.14 - Performance Tuning
- 1.15 - Mutation Score
- 1.16 - Code Quality

---

## ✅ Summary Epic 1

**8 stories can start immediately** (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.13, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16)
**2 stories need to wait** for 1.2 completion (1.5, 1.6)

All Epic 1 stories can be completed in parallel with proper coordination, reducing timeline from sequential ~30 days to parallel ~10 days.

## 🎯 Cross-Epic Dependencies

```
Epic 1 (Foundation)
    ↓
Epic 2 (TUI Core) ←──┐
    ↓                │
Epic 3 (Templates) ───┤ Can run in parallel
    ↓                │
Epic 4 (Intelligence)─┘
    ↓
Epic 5 (Production)
```

### Key Insights:
1. **Epic 2 & 3 can partially overlap** - Template system doesn't need full TUI
2. **Epic 5 stories 5.3 & 5.4** can start anytime (documentation/build)
3. **Epic 4 needs Epic 2** but not Epic 3 (except for some advanced features)
