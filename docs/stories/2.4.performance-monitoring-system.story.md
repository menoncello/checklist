## Dev Notes

### Performance Monitoring Architecture

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#performance]
The performance monitoring system is located in `packages/tui/src/performance/` with the following key components:

- PerformanceMonitor.ts - Main monitoring orchestration
- StartupProfiler.ts - Application startup performance tracking
- MemoryTracker.ts - Memory usage and leak detection
- MetricsCollector.ts - Metrics aggregation and storage

### Debug System Architecture

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#debug]
Debug utilities are in `packages/tui/src/debug/`:

- DebugRenderer.ts - Overlay rendering system
- EventLogger.ts - Event tracking for debugging
- StateInspector.ts - Application state debugging
- DebugCommands.ts - Debug mode command handlers

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#performance]

- Tinybench 2.5.x for micro-benchmarks (validates <100ms requirement)
- Chrome DevTools (Built-in) for performance profiling
- Custom Monitor 1.0.0 for TUI performance tracking (Story 1.8 - <50ms requirements)
- Performance requirements: <50ms response time, <50MB memory baseline

### Logging Infrastructure

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#logging]

- Pino 9.x for high-performance JSON logging
- pino-roll 1.x for log file rotation
- pino-pretty 10.x for development log formatting
- Log files stored in .logs/ directory with subdirectories for info/error/debug

### Health Monitoring Integration

[Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md#health-check-system]
The HealthMonitor class provides a framework for registering health checks. Performance monitoring should integrate by:

- Registering performance health checks
- Reporting status as 'healthy', 'unhealthy', or 'critical'
- Including duration metrics in health reports

### Resource Limiting

[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#resource-limiter]
ResourceLimiter class provides execution limits:

- executionTime: 5000ms default
- memoryDelta: 10MB default
- cpuUsage: 80% default
  Integrate with performance monitoring to enforce these limits

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#performance-testing]

- Performance tests must validate <100ms response time
- Memory usage must stay constant with 10,000 items (virtual scrolling)
- Use FlakyTestDetector for performance test reliability
- Visual regression testing with pixelmatch for debug overlay
- Mutation testing threshold: 85% minimum

### File Organization Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Use ESLint rules: no-console (use debug logger), prefer-const, no-var
- Use Bun.env instead of process.env for better performance
- TypeScript strict mode enabled, no 'any' types without justification
- Import organization: builtin, external, internal, parent, sibling, index
- Maximum line length: 80 characters

### Testing

- Test files colocated with source: *.test.ts
- Unit tests for each monitoring component
- Integration tests in tests/integration/
- Performance benchmarks in tests/performance/
- Coverage requirement: 90% for core monitoring components
- Use Bun's native test runner with built-in coverage

#### Critical Risks Identified (Must Fix)

1. **PERF-001**: Performance monitor overhead risk - High probability of exceeding 2% budget without careful implementation
2. **SEC-001**: Sensitive data exposure in metrics export - Stack traces and memory snapshots may contain passwords/API keys
3. **DATA-001**: Memory leak in long-running sessions - Continuous metrics collection without cleanup causes memory growth

#### Risk Summary

- **Total Risks**: 15 (3 Critical, 4 High, 5 Medium, 3 Low)
- **Highest Risk Areas**: Performance overhead, security in exports, memory management
- **Testing Priority**: Performance overhead validation, security audit, 24-hour endurance testing

#### Key Recommendations

1. **Must Fix Before Production**:

   - Implement monitoring circuit breaker if overhead >2%
   - Add comprehensive data sanitization for exports
   - Use circular buffers for metrics storage
2. **Critical Testing Required**:

   - Load testing with 10,000+ items to verify <2% overhead
   - Security penetration testing of metrics exports
   - 24-hour memory leak detection tests
3. **Deployment Strategy**:

   - Use feature flags for gradual rollout

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-27 (Initial)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Overall implementation demonstrates strong architectural design with comprehensive performance monitoring capabilities. The system successfully implements core monitoring infrastructure with circuit breaker protection, data sanitization, and metrics export. However, critical gaps exist in memory leak detection and profiling tools that prevent full production readiness.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary - code structure is clean and modular, though the 68-file split for PerformanceMonitor may be excessive.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ TypeScript strict mode, proper imports, ESLint compliant
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows monorepo organization, proper separation of concerns
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Coverage below 90% target, critical tests skipped
- All ACs Met: ✗ AC4 (memory leak) and AC8 (profiling) partially implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Activate MemoryTracker.test.ts and fix failing tests
- [ ] Implement 24-hour endurance test for memory leak validation
- [ ] Complete Task 8: StartupProfiler with decorators and DevTools integration
- [ ] Increase test coverage to 90% for core components
- [ ] Consider consolidating PerformanceMonitor's 68 files for maintainability
- [ ] Add integration tests for memory leak detection scenarios
- [ ] Document profiling workflow in development guides
- [ ] Implement Chrome DevTools Protocol integration

### Security Review

Strong security posture with DataSanitizer implementing 9+ PII redaction patterns. No hardcoded secrets or credentials found. Stack traces properly sanitized before export. No security concerns requiring immediate action.

### Performance Considerations

Excellent performance protection with PerformanceCircuitBreaker enforcing 2% overhead limit. All performance budgets met (<50ms render, <100ms startup). Circular buffer prevents unbounded memory growth. System designed for minimal performance impact.

### Files Modified During Review

No files modified - code quality acceptable as-is, issues are completeness rather than quality.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/2.4-performance-monitoring-system.yml
Risk profile: docs/qa/assessments/2.4-performance-monitoring-20250925.md
NFR assessment: docs/qa/assessments/2.4-performance-monitoring-nfr-20250927.md
Traceability: docs/qa/assessments/2.4-performance-monitoring-trace-20250927.md

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above
(Story owner decides final status)

**Critical Actions Required:**
1. Complete memory leak detection testing (AC4)
2. Finish profiling helpers implementation (AC8)
3. Achieve 90% test coverage target

The performance monitoring system is well-architected and implements most requirements successfully. However, the gaps in memory leak detection and profiling tools are significant enough to warrant CONCERNS status. With approximately 8 hours of work to address these items, the story would achieve full compliance.
