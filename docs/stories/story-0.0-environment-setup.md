### Tech Stack Reference

From architecture docs, the project uses:

- **Runtime**: Bun 1.1.x (primary), Node.js (fallback)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.3.x
- **Testing**: Vitest 1.6.x with coverage-v8
- **Linting**: ESLint 8.57.x with TypeScript plugin
- **Formatting**: Prettier 3.2.x
- **State Management**: YAML with js-yaml 4.1.x
- **Schema Validation**: Ajv 8.12.x

### Required VS Code Extensions

1. **TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features** (built-in)
2. **ESLint** (dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
3. **Prettier** (esbenp.prettier-vscode)
4. **EditorConfig** (EditorConfig.EditorConfig)

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# .env file content
NODE_ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=debug
CHECKLIST_HOME=$HOME/.checklist
ENABLE_TELEMETRY=false
```

### Common Setup Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Verify setup
bun --version
bun pm ls
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun run format:check
bun test:smoke

# Development commands
bun run dev        # Start development mode
bun run build      # Build all packages
bun run test       # Run full test suite
bun run test:watch # Run tests in watch mode
```

### Platform-Specific Notes

- **Windows**: Use WSL2 for best compatibility
- **macOS**: Requires Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
- **Linux**: May need build-essential package (`sudo apt install build-essential`)
- **Corporate Proxy**: Configure git and bun proxy settings if behind firewall

## Testing

### Testing Standards

Based on architecture documentation:

1. **Test File Locations**:
   - Unit tests: `*.test.ts` files colocated with source
   - Integration tests: `*.spec.ts` files in `__tests__` directories
   - E2E tests: `e2e/*.e2e.ts` files

2. **Testing Framework**:
   - Vitest 1.6.x for all testing
   - Use `describe`, `it`, `expect` syntax
   - Snapshot testing for TUI output validation

3. **Test Coverage Requirements**:
   - Minimum 80% code coverage
   - Coverage reports via `@vitest/coverage-v8`
   - Run: `bun run test:coverage`

4. **Test Data Management**:
   - Use TestDataFactory for test data creation
   - Create test workspaces in temp directories
   - Always cleanup after tests

5. **Smoke Test Requirements**:
   - Basic environment verification
   - Package loading confirmation
   - No external dependencies

### Validation Commands

```bash
# Verify Bun installation
bun --version  # Should output 1.1.x or higher

# Verify project setup
bun install
bun test:smoke  # Basic smoke test to verify setup

# Verify workspace configuration
bun pm ls  # Should list all workspace packages

# Verify TypeScript compilation
bun run typecheck

# Verify terminal capabilities
echo $TERM  # Should support colors
locale  # Should show UTF-8 encoding

# Test TUI rendering capability
bun run examples/terminal-test.ts
```

### Requirements Traceability Analysis - 2025-09-05

**Traceability Matrix**: docs/qa/assessments/0.0-trace-20250905.md

#### Coverage Summary

- **Total Requirements**: 18 Acceptance Criteria
- **Fully Covered**: 6 (33%)
- **Partially Covered**: 8 (44%)
- **Not Covered**: 4 (22%)

#### Critical Gaps Identified

1. **Pre-commit Hooks (AC9)** - NO COVERAGE
   - Risk: High - Quality checks may be bypassed
   - Recommendation: Implement husky with verification tests

2. **Environment Variables (AC10)** - PARTIAL
   - Risk: Medium - Runtime configuration errors
   - Recommendation: Add .env loading validation tests

3. **External Services (AC11-13)** - NO COVERAGE
   - Risk: Medium - Late discovery of access issues
   - Recommendation: Add connectivity verification tests

#### Test Coverage Assessment

**Well Covered Areas**:

- Build tooling (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript) - AC15-17
- Test execution framework - AC18
- Terminal capabilities - AC4
- Core smoke tests - AC7

**Areas Needing Attention**:

### Quality Gate Decision - 2025-09-05

**Reviewed By**: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/0.0-environment-setup.yml

### Comprehensive Review - 2025-09-05 14:45

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The development environment setup shows good foundational implementation with well-configured tooling (TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest). However, actual implementation depth is minimal with only placeholder code in packages. Test coverage is critically low at 5.38% vs 80% target. Core infrastructure is functional but lacks production readiness.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed - current implementations are minimal placeholders with no complex logic to refactor. Focus should be on implementing actual functionality rather than refactoring stubs.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, Prettier all properly configured
- Project Structure: ✓ All 4 packages (core, cli, tui, shared) present with correct workspace setup
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Only 5.38% coverage vs 80% requirement; tests exist but minimal implementation to test
- All ACs Met: ✗ Missing README.md (AC7) and performance budget implementation (AC8)

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical - Must Fix:**

- [ ] Create README.md with setup instructions and project overview (AC7 requirement)
- [ ] Implement performance budget monitoring (<50ms startup, <50MB memory, <20MB binary)
- [ ] Increase test coverage from 5.38% to minimum 80%
- [ ] Implement actual business logic beyond placeholders

**Important - Should Address:**

- [ ] Replace console.log with proper logging framework
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling patterns
- [ ] Enhance pre-commit hook security patterns
- [ ] Add integration tests for complete workflows
- [ ] Document API with generated typedocs

### Security Review

**Positives:**

- Basic secrets scanning in pre-commit hooks covering common patterns
- Environment variables properly isolated in .env with .env.example template
- No hardcoded secrets detected

**Concerns:**

- Pre-commit hook patterns could be more comprehensive
- No security-focused ESLint plugins configured
- Missing CI/CD integration for automated security scanning

### Performance Considerations

**Critical Gap:** No performance budget implementation despite AC8 requirement. Need to add:

- Startup time measurement (target <50ms)
- Memory usage monitoring (target <50MB)
- Binary size tracking (target <20MB)

Current Bun runtime choice is good for performance but metrics not tracked.

### Files Modified During Review

No files modified - review only. Current implementations are too minimal to warrant refactoring.

### Trace Analysis

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage:**

- AC1-6: ✓ Fully covered (Bun, TypeScript, monorepo, linting, testing, git)
- AC7: ✗ MISSING - No README.md file exists at project root
- AC8: ✗ MISSING - No performance budget implementation or monitoring

**Test Coverage by Package:**

- Core: 100% (but minimal implementation)
- CLI: 0% (placeholder only)
- TUI: 0% (placeholder only)
- Shared: 0% (placeholder only)
- **Overall: 5.38%** (Target: 80%)

### Risk Assessment

**High Risks:**

- Test coverage at 5.38% creates high regression risk
- No README blocks developer onboarding
- Missing performance monitoring prevents regression detection

**Medium Risks:**

- Placeholder implementations may hide integration issues
- No error handling patterns established

**Low Risks:**

- Configuration drift (mitigated by strict configs)

### Gate Status

Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/0.0-environment-setup-comprehensive.yml
Risk profile: High - Critical gaps in test coverage and missing deliverables
NFR assessment: Security-CONCERNS, Performance-FAIL, Reliability-CONCERNS, Maintainability-FAIL

### Recommended Status

✗ **Changes Required** - Critical issues must be addressed:

1. Create README.md (AC7)
2. Implement performance monitoring (AC8)
3. Increase test coverage to 80% minimum
4. Implement actual business logic beyond stubs

Story should return to **InProgress** status until these critical gaps are resolved.
