# Story 6.1: Migrate to Turborepo for Enhanced Build Performance

## Status

**To Do**

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to migrate the current build system to Turborepo,
**so that** I can benefit from improved build performance, intelligent caching, and better monorepo management.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Current Bun workspace build system (package.json workspaces)
- Technology: Bun 1.1.x, TypeScript 5.9+, existing npm scripts
- Follows pattern: Monorepo with packages/core, packages/cli, packages/tui, packages/shared
- Touch points: All package builds, test scripts, linting, and development workflows

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. Turborepo is successfully integrated into the project
2. All existing build scripts work with Turborepo tasks
3. Development and production builds maintain same outputs
4. Build caching provides measurable performance improvements

### Integration Requirements

4. Existing package.json workspaces continue to work unchanged during transition
5. New Turborepo tasks follow existing script naming patterns
6. Integration with CI/CD pipeline maintains current behavior
7. All package interdependencies are preserved

### Quality Requirements

8. Build performance improves by at least 30% for subsequent builds
9. Documentation is updated with new Turborepo commands
10. No regression in existing functionality verified
11. Development experience (watch mode, hot reload) is maintained or improved

## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:**
- Install Turborepo as dev dependency
- Create turbo.json configuration with task definitions
- Map existing npm scripts to Turborepo tasks
- Configure caching strategies for builds, tests, and linting
- Gradually migrate workflows while maintaining compatibility

**Existing Pattern Reference:**
- Current build scripts in package.json:10-50
- Workspace configuration in package.json:6-8
- Test scripts: package.json:18-28
- Quality scripts: package.json:30-40

**Key Constraints:**
- Must maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Cannot break existing CI/CD pipeline
- Development workflow must remain seamless
- All package builds must produce identical outputs

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Setup and Configuration
1. Install Turborepo as dev dependency
2. Create turbo.json with task definitions
3. Configure output filtering and caching
4. Set up pipeline dependencies between packages

### Phase 2: Task Migration
1. Convert build scripts to Turborepo tasks
2. Migrate test scripts with proper caching
3. Update linting and formatting tasks
4. Configure development server tasks

### Phase 3: Integration and Validation
1. Update CI/CD pipeline to use Turborepo
2. Verify all builds produce identical outputs
3. Performance benchmarking and validation
4. Documentation updates

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Turborepo successfully integrated and configured
- [ ] All existing build workflows work with Turborepo
- [ ] Build performance improvements measured and validated
- [ ] Development experience maintained or improved
- [ ] Documentation updated with new commands
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline working with new build system
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Build output differences or caching issues
- **Mitigation**: Gradual migration with fallback to original scripts, extensive testing
- **Rollback**: Revert to original package.json scripts if issues arise

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Build outputs remain identical to current system
- [ ] Development workflow patterns are preserved
- [ ] Performance impact is positive or neutral

## Success Metrics

- Build time reduction: Target 30%+ improvement on subsequent builds
- Cache hit rate: Target 80%+ for unchanged code
- Developer experience: No regression in watch mode or development workflows
- Zero breaking changes to existing functionality

## Dependencies

- Current Bun workspace setup (package.json:6-8)
- Existing build scripts (package.json:10-50)
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Team familiarity with current build process

## Notes

This migration should be approached incrementally to ensure zero disruption to the development workflow. The goal is to enhance performance while maintaining full compatibility with existing processes.
