# Epic 4: Production Readiness

## Status: 🔒 BLOCKED (0% Complete - 0/10 stories) - Waiting for Epics 1-3

## Goal

Establish comprehensive testing, documentation, packaging, and distribution systems to ensure the checklist manager is production-ready and maintainable.

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Performance testing and benchmarks in place
- ✅ Binary packaging and distribution working
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (API and User)
- ✅ Installation processes for all platforms
- ✅ Telemetry and analytics framework ready
- ✅ Production deployment and monitoring operational

### 🔒 Blocked - Waiting for Prerequisites
1. [Story 4.1: Testing Framework](story-4.1-testing-framework.md) 📝 **READY**
2. [Story 4.2: Performance Testing](story-4.2-performance-testing.md) 📝 **READY**
3. [Story 4.3: Build & Package System](story-4.3-build-package.md) 📝 **READY**
4. [Story 4.4: Installation & Updates](story-4.4-installation-updates.md) 📝 **READY**
5. [Story 4.5: Documentation Suite](story-4.5-documentation-suite.md) 📝 **READY**
6. [Story 4.6: Error Recovery](story-4.6-error-recovery.md) 📝 **READY**
7. [Story 4.7: Telemetry & Analytics](story-4.7-telemetry-analytics.md) 📝 **READY**

10. [Story 4.10: User Documentation](story-4.10-user-documentation.md) 📝 **READY**

## Dependencies

- Epics 1-3 must be complete (core functionality to test and document)
- ✅ Story 1.2 (CI/CD) **COMPLETE** - supports automated testing
- ✅ Story 1.3 (Testing Framework) **COMPLETE** - foundation ready
- Story 1.7 (Performance Monitoring) needed for 4.2 (not yet complete)
- Epic 2 & 3 completion required before production readiness

## Risk Factors

- 🟡 Cross-platform packaging complexity
- 🟡 Documentation maintenance overhead
- ✅ ~~Testing coverage gaps~~ **MITIGATED** - Testing framework established in Epic 1

## Timeline Estimate

**2 weeks** (after Epics 1-3 complete)
