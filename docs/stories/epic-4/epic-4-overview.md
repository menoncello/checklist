# Epic 4: Production Readiness

## Goal

Establish comprehensive testing, documentation, packaging, and distribution systems to ensure the checklist manager is production-ready and maintainable.

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Performance testing and benchmarks in place
- ✅ Binary packaging and distribution working
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (API and User)
- ✅ Installation processes for all platforms
- ✅ Telemetry and analytics framework ready
- ✅ Production deployment and monitoring operational

## Stories

1. [Story 4.1: Testing Framework](story-4.1-testing-framework.md) ⚠️ **MOVED TO EPIC 1 AS STORY 1.3**
2. [Story 4.2: Performance Testing](story-4.2-performance-testing.md)
3. [Story 4.3: Build and Package System](story-4.3-build-package.md)
4. [Story 4.4: Installation and Updates](story-4.4-installation-updates.md)
5. [Story 4.5: Documentation Suite](story-4.5-documentation-suite.md)
6. [Story 4.6: Telemetry and Analytics](story-4.6-telemetry-analytics.md)
7. [Story 4.7: Command Safety System](story-4.7-command-safety.md)
8. [Story 4.8: API Documentation Generation](story-4.8-api-documentation.md)
9. [Story 4.9: User Help & Tutorial System](story-4.9-user-documentation.md)

## Dependencies

- Epics 1-3 complete (core functionality to test and document)
- Story 1.2 (CI/CD) supports automated testing
- Story 1.3 (Testing Framework) provides foundation for production testing
- Story 1.7 (Performance Monitoring) feeds into 4.2

## Risk Factors

- 🟡 Cross-platform packaging complexity
- 🟡 Documentation maintenance overhead
- 🟢 Testing coverage gaps (MITIGATED by moving testing to Epic 1)

## Timeline Estimate

**2-3 weeks** with new documentation stories (was 1-2 weeks)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tests passing with >80% coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established and met
- [ ] Binary packages building for all platforms
- [ ] API documentation complete and published
- [ ] User documentation and tutorials ready
- [ ] Installation tested on macOS, Linux, Windows
- [ ] Telemetry framework operational
- [ ] Command safety measures in place
