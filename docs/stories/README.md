## Story Status Legend

- ‚ö° **Prerequisites** - Must be completed before any development
- üö® **Critical Path** - Blocks multiple other stories
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk** - Has significant technical risk
- üîÑ **Parallel** - Can be worked on simultaneously with other stories
- ‚úÖ **Complete** - Story has been implemented and tested
- üöß **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- üìù **Ready** - Ready to be started
- üîí **Blocked** - Waiting on dependencies

## Quick Start for Developers

1. **First Time Setup**
   ```bash
   # Start with Story 0.0
   open docs/stories/story-0.0-environment-setup.md
   # Follow all setup instructions
   ```

2. **Begin Development**
   ```bash
   # After environment setup, start Epic 1
   open docs/stories/epic-1/epic-1-overview.md
   # Begin with Story 1.1
   ```

3. **Check TUI Decision**
   ```bash
   # After Story 1.2 (TUI Spike)
   open docs/stories/tui-spike-mitigation-plan.md
   # Follow appropriate path based on spike results
   ```

## Key Documents

- **Product Requirements**: [docs/prd.md](../prd.md)
- **Architecture**: [docs/architecture.md](../architecture.md)
- **UI/UX Specification**: [docs/front-end-spec.md](../front-end-spec.md)
- **TUI Mitigation Plan**: [tui-spike-mitigation-plan.md](tui-spike-mitigation-plan.md)

## Estimation Summary

| Epic | Duration | Dependencies | Risk Level |
|------|----------|--------------|------------|
| Epic 0 (Setup) | 2-4 hours | None | Low |
| Epic 1 (Foundation) | 2-3 weeks | Story 0.0 | High (TUI spike) |
| Epic 2 (TUI) | 2-3 weeks | Epic 1 success | Medium |
| Epic 3 (Templates) | 2 weeks | Epic 1 | Medium |
| Epic 4 (Safety) | 1-2 weeks | Epics 1-2 | Low |
| Epic 5 (Production) | 1-2 weeks | All epics | Low |

**Total Estimated Duration**: 7-10 weeks for full implementation

## MVP Adjustment Options

### Minimal MVP (3-4 weeks)
- Epic 1 + CLI-only interface
- Basic templates (Epic 3 reduced scope)
- Skip Epic 2 (TUI) entirely

### Standard MVP (5-6 weeks)
- Epics 1-3 complete
- Epic 4 partial (core safety only)
- Epic 5 documentation only

### Full Release (7-10 weeks)
- All 5 epics complete
- Full TUI + CLI
- Community features ready

## Notes for Project Manager

1. **Story 1.2 is the critical decision point** - Have stakeholders available on Day 3 of the spike
2. **Parallel work opportunities** exist between Epic 2 and Epic 3
3. **CLI fallback** ensures value delivery even if TUI fails
4. **Each epic has clear "Definition of Done"** in its overview file
5. **Time estimates are conservative** - may complete faster with experienced team

## Contributing

When creating new stories:
1. Use the existing story templates as reference
2. Include clear acceptance criteria
3. Add time estimates
4. Note dependencies explicitly
5. Include "Definition of Done"
6. Add technical implementation notes where helpful
