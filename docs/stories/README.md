## Story Status Legend

- ‚ö° **Prerequisites** - Must be completed before any development
- üö® **Critical Path** - Blocks multiple other stories
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk** - Has significant technical risk
- üîÑ **Parallel** - Can be worked on simultaneously with other stories
- ‚úÖ **Complete** - Story has been implemented and tested
- üöß **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- üìù **Ready** - Ready to be started
- üîí **Blocked** - Waiting on dependencies

## Quick Start for Developers

1. **First Time Setup**
   ```bash
   # Start with Story 0.0
   open docs/stories/story-0.0-environment-setup.md
   # Follow all setup instructions
   ```

2. **Begin Development**
   ```bash
   # After environment setup, start Epic 1
   open docs/stories/epic-1/epic-1-overview.md
   # Begin with Story 1.1
   ```

3. **Check TUI Decision**
   ```bash
   # After Story 1.2 (TUI Spike)
   open docs/stories/tui-spike-mitigation-plan.md
   # Follow appropriate path based on spike results
   ```

## Key Documents

- **Product Requirements**: [docs/prd.md](../prd.md)
- **Architecture**: [docs/architecture.md](../architecture.md)
- **UI/UX Specification**: [docs/front-end-spec.md](../front-end-spec.md)
- **TUI Mitigation Plan**: [tui-spike-mitigation-plan.md](tui-spike-mitigation-plan.md)

## Estimation Summary

| Epic | Duration | Dependencies | Risk Level |
|------|----------|--------------|------------|
| Epic 0 (Setup) | 2-4 hours | None | Low |
| Epic 1 (Foundation) | 3 weeks | Story 0.0 | High (TUI spike) - EXTENDED |
| Epic 2 (UI/Interaction) | 2 weeks | Epic 1 success | Medium |
| Epic 3 (Templates) | 2 weeks | Epic 1 | Medium |
| Epic 4 (Production) | 2 weeks | Epics 1-3 | Low (TDD enabled) |
| Epic 5 (Community) | Post-MVP | All epics | Low |

**Total Estimated Duration**: 8-9 weeks for MVP (without Epic 5) - extended due to critical additions

## MVP Adjustment Options

### Minimal MVP (4 weeks)
- Epic 1 + CLI-only interface
- Basic templates (Epic 3 reduced scope)
- Skip Epic 2 (TUI) entirely

### Standard MVP (8 weeks) ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED**
- Epics 1-4 complete
- Full TUI + CLI interface
- Templates with security
- Production-ready with recovery
- Documentation complete

### Full Release (10-12 weeks)
- All 5 epics complete
- Community features
- Template marketplace
- Team collaboration

## Notes for Project Manager

1. **Story 1.4 (TUI Spike) is the critical decision point** - Have stakeholders available after Story 1.3 completion (formerly numbered 1.3, now 1.4)
2. **CRITICAL: New foundation stories added based on PO validation:**
   - Story 1.0: Database/State Store Setup - MUST complete before any state operations
   - Story 1.3: Testing Framework moved from Epic 4 to enable TDD from day 1
   - Story 1.2: Enhanced with third-party integration requirements
3. **Additional new stories:**
   - Story 1.6a/b: State transactions and migrations for data integrity
   - Story 3.8: Template documentation for user enablement
   - Story 4.5: Error recovery for reliability
4. **Story reordering applied:**
   - Critical path: 1.0 ‚Üí 1.5 ‚Üí 1.6 (Database ‚Üí State ‚Üí Workflow)
   - Testing moved early for TDD adoption
   - Performance monitoring moved up for early warning
5. **Epic 5 deferred to post-MVP** - reduces timeline by 2 weeks
6. **Parallel work opportunities** exist between Epic 2 and Epic 3
7. **Risk mitigation achieved:**
   - File corruption prevented (Story 1.0)
   - Third-party integration failures mitigated (Story 1.2)
   - Late testing debt prevented (Story 1.3)
8. **Each epic has clear "Definition of Done"** in its overview file

## Contributing

When creating new stories:
1. Use the existing story templates as reference
2. Include clear acceptance criteria
3. Add time estimates
4. Note dependencies explicitly
5. Include "Definition of Done"
6. Add technical implementation notes where helpful
