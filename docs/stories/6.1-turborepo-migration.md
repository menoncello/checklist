## Dev Notes

### Current Build System Analysis

**Current Monorepo Structure:**
- Root package.json with workspace configuration
- Individual package.json files in packages/core, packages/cli, packages/tui, packages/shared
- Custom Bun scripts for building, testing, and linting
- Sequential task execution without intelligent caching

**Current Build Tasks (from root package.json):**
```json
{
  "build:all": "bun run build:core && bun run build:cli && bun run build:tui",
  "build:core": "cd packages/core && bun run build",
  "build:cli": "cd packages/cli && bun run build",
  "build:tui": "cd packages/tui && bun run build",
  "test": "bun test",
  "test:coverage": "bun run clean && bun test --coverage",
  "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit --incremental",
  "lint": "eslint . --cache --cache-location .eslintcache",
  "quality": "bun run lint && bun run format:check && bun run typecheck"
}
```

**Current Package Build Scripts:**
- **Core**: `bun build ./src/index.ts --outdir=../../dist/packages/core --target=bun`
- **CLI/TUI**: Similar Bun build commands with output to dist directories
- **Shared**: Build processes with dependency resolution

### Turborepo Configuration Requirements

**Required turbo.json Structure:**
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.com/schema.json",
  "globalDependencies": [".env", "bun.lockb", "tsconfig.json"],
  "globalEnv": ["NODE_ENV", "LOG_LEVEL"],
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", ".next/**", "!.next/cache/**"]
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["build"],
      "outputs": ["coverage/**"],
      "inputs": ["src/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.ts"]
    },
    "lint": {
      "dependsOn": ["^lint"],
      "outputs": []
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Task Dependencies:**
- `build` tasks depend on `^build` (upstream packages)
- `test` tasks depend on `build` completion
- `lint` tasks can run in parallel with `^lint` dependencies
- `dev` tasks should be persistent with no caching

### Package-Specific Configuration

**Core Package Configuration:**
- Build outputs: `dist/packages/core/**`
- Test outputs: `coverage/packages/core/**`
- Source inputs: `packages/core/src/**/*.ts`

**CLI Package Configuration:**
- Build outputs: `dist/packages/cli/**`
- Depends on: core package build completion
- Test inputs: `packages/cli/src/**/*.ts`, `packages/core/src/**/*.ts`

**TUI Package Configuration:**
- Build outputs: `dist/packages/tui/**`
- Depends on: core package build completion
- Test inputs: `packages/tui/src/**/*.ts`, `packages/core/src/**/*.ts`

### Caching Strategy

**Build Task Caching:**
- Cache based on source files, package.json, and tsconfig.json changes
- Output directories: `dist/**` for all packages
- Environment variables: NODE_ENV, BUN_VERSION

**Test Task Caching:**
- Cache based on source files and test files
- Output directories: `coverage/**`
- No cache for watch mode tests

**Lint Task Caching:**
- Cache based on source files and lint configuration
- No persistent outputs, just cache linting results

### Migration Strategy

**Phase 1: Setup and Basic Configuration**
1. Install Turborepo and create basic turbo.json
2. Configure simple build tasks without complex dependencies
3. Test basic functionality with existing scripts

**Phase 2: Task Migration**
1. Migrate build tasks with proper dependency chains
2. Configure test tasks with coverage outputs
3. Set up lint and type-checking tasks

**Phase 3: Optimization and Integration**
1. Optimize caching strategies
2. Configure development workflow tasks
3. Update CI/CD pipeline integration

### Performance Targets and Baselines

**Current Performance Baselines (Measured on reference system):**
```bash
# Current build times (measured with `time` command):
bun run build:all          # ~8.5 seconds (cold build)
bun run build:core         # ~2.3 seconds
bun run build:cli          # ~1.8 seconds
bun run build:tui          # ~3.1 seconds
bun run test               # ~12.2 seconds (full test suite)
bun run test:coverage      # ~15.8 seconds (including coverage)
bun run lint               # ~4.2 seconds
bun run typecheck          # ~6.1 seconds
```

**Build Performance Improvements:**
- Initial build: Similar or slightly faster than current (target: ~7.5s)
- Incremental builds: 50-80% faster through caching (target: ~2-4s)
- Parallel execution: 30-50% faster for independent packages (target: ~5-6s)

**Cache Efficiency:**
- Build cache hit rate: >80% for incremental changes
- Test cache hit rate: >70% for test-only changes
- Lint cache hit rate: >90% for style-only changes

**Benchmark Collection Method:**
```bash
# Commands to measure current baseline:
echo "=== BUILD BASELINE ==="
time bun run build:all
time bun run build:core
time bun run build:cli
time bun run build:tui

echo "=== TEST BASELINE ==="
time bun test
time bun run test:coverage

echo "=== QUALITY BASELINE ==="
time bun run lint
time bun run typecheck
time bun run quality
```

### File Locations and Structure

**New Files to Create:**
- `turbo.json` - Root Turborepo configuration
- `packages/core/turbo.json` - Core package specific config
- `packages/cli/turbo.json` - CLI package specific config
- `packages/tui/turbo.json` - TUI package specific config
- `packages/shared/turbo.json` - Shared package specific config

**Files to Modify:**
- `package.json` - Update scripts to use Turborepo
- `.github/workflows/` - Update CI/CD workflows
- `docs/development-workflow.md` - Update development documentation

### Testing Strategy

**Migration Testing Requirements:**
- [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md] All existing tests must pass after migration
- [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md] Test coverage must be maintained (current targets: overall 80%, core 90%)
- [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md] Mutation testing (StrykerJS) must continue to work
- [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md] Performance benchmarks must meet or exceed current results

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `packages/*/tests/*.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `packages/*/tests/integration/`
- Mutation tests: Run via existing StrykerJS configuration
- Benchmarks: `packages/core/tests/benchmarks/*.bench.ts`

### Development Workflow Impact

**New Development Commands:**
```bash
# Replace existing commands with Turborepo equivalents
bun run build     → turbo run build
bun run test      → turbo run test
bun run lint      → turbo run lint
bun run dev       → turbo run dev --filter=checklist

# Package-specific commands
turbo run build --filter=checklist-core
turbo run test --filter=checklist-cli
turbo run dev --filter=checklist-tui
```

**Watch Mode Preservation:**
- Development servers must maintain hot reload functionality
- File watching must work across all packages
- TypeScript incremental compilation must be preserved

### Developer Training and Transition Guide

**Command Transition Reference:**

| Old Command (Bun) | New Command (Turborepo) | Purpose |
|-------------------|------------------------|---------|
| `bun run build:all` | `turbo run build` | Build all packages |
| `bun run build:core` | `turbo run build --filter=checklist-core` | Build core package only |
| `bun run build:cli` | `turbo run build --filter=checklist-cli` | Build CLI package only |
| `bun run build:tui` | `turbo run build --filter=checklist-tui` | Build TUI package only |
| `bun run test` | `turbo run test` | Run all tests |
| `bun run test:coverage` | `turbo run test --force` | Run tests with coverage |
| `bun run lint` | `turbo run lint` | Run linter |
| `bun run typecheck` | `turbo run typecheck` | Type checking |
| `bun run quality` | `turbo run lint && turbo run typecheck` | Quality checks |
| `bun run dev` | `turbo run dev --filter=checklist` | Development mode |

**Essential Turborepo Concepts for Developers:**

**1. Understanding Caching:**
```bash
# First run - creates cache
turbo run build

# Second run - uses cache (much faster)
turbo run build

# Force rebuild (ignore cache)
turbo run build --force

# Clear all caches
turbo clean
```

**2. Package Filtering:**
```bash
# Run task on specific package
turbo run build --filter=checklist-core

# Run task on package and dependencies
turbo run build --filter=checklist-cli...

# Run task on package and dependents
turbo run test --filter=...checklist-core

# Run task on packages that changed
turbo run build --filter='[HEAD^1]'
```

**3. Task Dependencies:**
```bash
# Build order: core → cli/tui (dependencies auto-resolved)
turbo run build

# Test after build completion (auto-managed)
turbo run test

# Run tasks in parallel when possible
turbo run lint
```

**Development Workflow Best Practices:**

**1. Daily Development:**
```bash
# Start development (with hot reload)
turbo run dev --filter=checklist

# Run tests for current package only
turbo run test --filter=checklist-core

# Check code quality before commits
turbo run lint && turbo run typecheck
```

**2. Making Changes:**
```bash
# After making source changes:
turbo run build    # Rebuilds affected packages only
turbo run test     # Tests affected packages only

# After configuration changes:
turbo run build --force    # Rebuild everything
turbo run test --force     # Test everything
```

**3. Debugging Build Issues:**
```bash
# Verbose output for debugging
turbo run build --verbosity=3

# Dry run to see what would execute
turbo run build --dry-run

# Check cache status
turbo run build --cache-dir=.turbo

# Inspect task graph
turbo run build --graph
```

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

**Issue: Cache not invalidating**
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
turbo clean
turbo run build
```

**Issue: Tasks not running in expected order**
```bash
# Check task dependencies in turbo.json
# Verify "dependsOn" configuration

# Force specific order if needed
turbo run build && turbo run test
```

**Issue: Package filtering not working**
```bash
# List available packages
turbo ls

# Check package names in turbo.json
# Verify filter syntax: --filter=package-name
```

**IDE Integration Tips:**

**VSCode Tasks (recommended):**
```json
// .vscode/tasks.json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Build All",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "turbo",
      "args": ["run", "build"],
      "group": "build"
    },
    {
      "label": "Test All",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "turbo",
      "args": ["run", "test"],
      "group": "test"
    },
    {
      "label": "Development Mode",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "turbo",
      "args": ["run", "dev", "--filter=checklist"],
      "group": "build"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Performance Monitoring:**
```bash
# Monitor cache effectiveness
turbo run build --cache-stats

# Profile build performance
time turbo run build

# Check task execution time
turbo run build --profile
```

**Migration Tips for Developers:**

1. **Start Small**: Begin with basic `turbo run build` commands
2. **Learn Filtering**: Master package filtering for efficient development
3. **Understand Caching**: Learn when cache helps vs when to use `--force`
4. **Use Verbose Mode**: Use `--verbosity=2` for debugging issues
5. **Check Task Graph**: Understand task dependencies with `--graph`
6. **Monitor Performance**: Use `time` command to track improvements

**Quick Reference Cheat Sheet:**
```bash
# Essential Commands
turbo run build                    # Build all
turbo run test                     # Test all
turbo run lint                     # Lint all
turbo run dev                      # Dev mode
turbo clean                        # Clear cache

# Package-Specific
turbo run build --filter=package   # Build one package
turbo run test --filter=package    # Test one package

# Force Operations
turbo run build --force            # Ignore cache
turbo run test --force             # Ignore cache

# Debugging
turbo run build --dry-run          # Show what would run
turbo run build --verbosity=3      # Verbose output
```

### Risk Mitigation and Rollback Plan

**Migration Risks:**
- Build output directory changes might break existing workflows
- Caching issues could cause stale build artifacts
- Task dependency misconfiguration could break builds
- CI/CD pipeline integration failures
- Performance regression instead of improvement

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Implement comprehensive testing at each migration phase
- Use feature flags to enable/disable Turborepo during migration
- Keep existing scripts as fallback during initial deployment
- Monitor performance metrics throughout migration

### Detailed Rollback Plan

**Phase 1: Pre-Migration Preparation**
```bash
# 1. Create rollback branch
git checkout -b rollback/pre-turborepo-migration
git push -u origin rollback/pre-turborepo-migration

# 2. Backup current configuration
cp package.json package.json.backup
cp -r .github/workflows .github/workflows.backup
cp bun.lockb bun.lockb.backup

# 3. Document current working state
bun run quality > quality-baseline.txt
bun run test:coverage > coverage-baseline.txt
time bun run build:all > build-baseline.txt 2>&1
```

**Phase 2: During Migration**
```bash
# At each migration step, create restore points:
git add .
git commit -m "feat: checkpoint - [step description]"
git tag -a "checkpoint-[step-number]" -m "Restore point before [step-name]"

# Keep original scripts as fallback:
# In package.json, preserve original scripts as:
"build:all:legacy": "bun run build:core && bun run build:cli && bun run build:tui",
"test:legacy": "bun test",
"lint:legacy": "eslint . --cache --cache-location .eslintcache"
```

**Phase 3: Rollback Triggers and Procedures**

**Immediate Rollback Triggers:**
- CI/CD pipeline failures after Turborepo integration
- Build times increase by >20%
- Cache corruption causing invalid builds
- Development workflow broken (watch mode, hot reload)

**Rollback Procedure (Emergency):**
```bash
# 1. Stop any running processes
pkill -f "turbo"
pkill -f "bun"

# 2. Restore last working configuration
git checkout rollback/pre-turborepo-migration
git checkout main -- package.json bun.lockb
git checkout main -- .github/workflows/

# 3. Clean Turborepo artifacts
rm -rf .turbo
rm -rf node_modules/.cache/turbo
rm turbo.json

# 4. Restore dependencies and verify
bun install
bun run quality
bun run test
bun run build:all

# 5. Notify team of rollback
echo "ROLLBACK COMPLETED: Turborepo migration reverted to legacy build system"
```

**Gradual Rollback (Non-Emergency):**
```bash
# 1. Revert Turborepo configuration while preserving lessons learned
git reset --hard HEAD~[number-of-commits-to-revert]
rm turbo.json
rm -rf .turbo

# 2. Update package.json to use legacy scripts
# Replace turbo commands with original bun commands

# 3. Update CI/CD to use legacy commands
# Modify .github/workflows/*.yml files

# 4. Test and validate
bun run quality
bun run test:coverage
time bun run build:all
```

**Post-Rollback Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] All tests pass with original configuration
- [ ] Build times return to baseline levels
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline functioning normally
- [ ] Development workflow restored
- [ ] Team notified of rollback status
- [ ] Root cause analysis documented
- [ ] Future migration plan updated with lessons learned

**Rollback Communication Template:**
