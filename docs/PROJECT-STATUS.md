# Project Status Report

**Date**: September 6, 2025  
**Sprint**: Epic 1 - Foundation & Validation

## Executive Summary

The Checklist project has successfully completed the foundational infrastructure phase with 4 out of 10 stories in Epic 1 completed. All critical foundation components are operational, including database/state management, CI/CD pipeline, and testing framework.

## Completed Stories

### ✅ Story 1.0: Database/State Store Setup
- **Status**: Done
- **Key Achievements**:
  - File-based state management with YAML
  - Transaction logging system
  - Backup and recovery mechanisms
  - File locking for concurrent access
  - Directory isolation for workspaces

### ✅ Story 1.1: Project Setup and Structure
- **Status**: Done
- **Key Achievements**:
  - Bun monorepo structure established
  - TypeScript configuration complete
  - ESLint and Prettier configured
  - Package structure defined (core, tui, cli, shared)
  - Development environment standardized

### ✅ Story 1.2: CI/CD Pipeline
- **Status**: Done
- **Key Achievements**:
  - GitHub Actions workflows configured
  - Multi-platform testing (macOS, Linux, Windows WSL)
  - Automated quality checks
  - Release automation
  - Security scanning integrated

### ✅ Story 1.3: Testing Framework Setup
- **Status**: Done
- **QA Gate**: PASS (100/100)
- **Key Achievements**:
  - 81.90% test coverage (exceeds 80% target)
  - 382 passing tests across 30 files
  - Comprehensive test utilities (TestDataFactory, FlakyTestDetector)
  - All test types operational (Unit, Integration, Snapshot, Visual, Performance, Accessibility)
  - Mutation testing with StrykerJS
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing
  - Pre-commit hooks with security scanning

## Current Metrics

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: 81.90%
- **Tests Passing**: 382/382 (100%)
- **Build Status**: ✅ Passing
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: 0 critical, 0 high

### Performance Metrics
- **Test Execution Time**: ~35 seconds
- **Build Time**: < 2 minutes
- **Memory Usage**: Within targets

## In Progress

### Story 1.4: TUI Technology Spike
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Priority**: CRITICAL PATH
- **Blockers**: None
- **Next Steps**: Begin spike to validate TUI approach

## Upcoming Work

1. **Story 1.4**: TUI Technology Spike (Critical)
2. **Story 1.5**: State Management Implementation
3. **Story 1.6**: Core Workflow Engine
4. **Story 1.7**: Performance Monitoring Framework
5. **Story 1.8**: Terminal Canvas System
6. **Story 1.9**: Component Base Architecture

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| TUI spike failure | High | Fallback to simpler CLI approach defined | Pending |
| Database corruption | High | File locking and backup systems implemented | ✅ Mitigated |
| Testing debt | Medium | Testing framework established early | ✅ Mitigated |
| CI/CD failures | Medium | Multi-platform testing configured | ✅ Mitigated |

## Technical Debt

- **None identified** - Project is in excellent technical health
- All linting warnings are acceptable (console.log in dev/test code)
- Type safety maintained throughout codebase

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Begin Story 1.4 (TUI Spike) as it's on critical path
   - Review and prioritize remaining Epic 1 stories

2. **Process Improvements**:
   - Continue enforcing >80% test coverage
   - Monitor mutation testing reports for quality gaps
   - Keep documentation updated with each story

3. **Technical Considerations**:
   - Consider implementing contract testing for package interfaces
   - Set up continuous monitoring of flaky tests
   - Plan for performance profiling integration

## Team Notes

The foundation phase has been executed exceptionally well with:
- Clean architecture established
- Robust testing practices in place
- CI/CD pipeline operational
- State management proven and tested

The project is well-positioned for the next phase of development with TDD practices enabled and quality gates established.

## Next Sprint Planning

**Sprint Goal**: Complete TUI validation and core engine implementation

**Target Stories**:
- Story 1.4: TUI Technology Spike (5-8 hours)
- Story 1.5: State Management Implementation (8-10 hours)
- Story 1.6: Core Workflow Engine (10-12 hours)

**Success Criteria**:
- TUI approach validated or fallback activated
- Core workflow engine operational without UI
- State management fully integrated
