# Epic 6 - Technical Debt Management

**Epic**: 6 - Technical Debt Management
**Status**: Ongoing
**Priority**: Medium
**Type**: Maintenance & Infrastructure
**Duration**: Ongoing

## Epic Goal

Systematically address and resolve technical debt across the BMAD Checklist Manager codebase to improve long-term maintainability, performance, and developer experience while ensuring system stability.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current functionality: Terminal-based interactive checklist application with clean architecture
- Technology stack: Bun 1.1.x, TypeScript 5.9+, monorepo with workspaces
- Integration points: Multiple packages (core, cli, tui, shared), build system, testing framework, CI/CD pipeline

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being addressed: Accumulated technical debt across build processes, dependency management, code quality, and performance optimization
- How it works: Systematic approach to identify, prioritize, and resolve technical debt items
- Success criteria: Improved build performance, simplified dependency management, enhanced code quality, better developer experience

## Stories

### Ongoing Stories

1. **Story 6.1**: Migrate build system to Turborepo for improved performance and caching
2. **Story 6.2**: Upgrade and optimize package dependencies across all workspaces
3. **Story 6.3**: Consolidate and optimize testing strategy for better performance
4. **Story 6.4**: Improve code documentation and inline comments
5. **Story 6.5**: Optimize bundle size and runtime performance
6. **Story 6.6**: Enhance error handling and logging consistency
7. **Story 6.7**: Refactor legacy code patterns and improve code consistency
8. **Story 6.8**: Improve accessibility and internationalization support

### Future Stories (To Be Defined)

- Performance optimization initiatives
- Security improvements and updates
- Developer experience enhancements
- Build tool modernization
- Testing infrastructure improvements

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged during debt resolution
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [ ] UI/UX patterns remain consistent
- [ ] Performance impact is positive or neutral
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Introducing regressions while addressing technical debt
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, gradual rollout, proper documentation
- **Rollback Plan**: Git versioning with ability to revert changes quickly

## Priority Framework

Technical debt items will be prioritized based on:

1. **Impact**: Effect on performance, maintainability, and developer experience
2. **Effort**: Complexity and time required to address
3. **Risk**: Potential for introducing regressions
4. **Value**: Long-term benefits to the codebase and users

## Definition of Done

Each technical debt story is complete when:
- [ ] Specific issue is resolved
- [ ] Tests pass and coverage is maintained
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet or exceed previous results
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Code review is completed and approved

## Monitoring and Metrics

- Build performance metrics (time, success rate)
- Code quality metrics (lint issues, coverage, complexity)
- Developer experience feedback
- Performance benchmarks
- Security scan results

## Ongoing Management

This epic serves as a container for technical debt management:
- Stories can be added as new technical debt is identified
- Priorities will be reassessed regularly
- Progress will be tracked through individual story completion
- Epic remains open as technical debt is an ongoing concern

## Dependencies

- Development team availability
- Stakeholder priorities for new features vs. debt resolution
- Critical bug fixes and hotfixes (take precedence)
