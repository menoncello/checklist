2. Begin Epic 2 (User Interface) development
3. Start Epic 3 (Templates) in parallel

### 🚀 Path to MVP

**Estimated Timeline to MVP**: 5-6 weeks
- Week 1-2: Complete Epic 1
- Week 2-3: Epic 2 (UI/Interaction)
- Week 3-4: Epic 3 (Templates)
- Week 5-6: Epic 4 (Production Readiness)

## Risk Assessment

### ✅ Risks Mitigated

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| TUI Technology Viability | Spike completed (1.4) | ✅ Resolved |
| State Corruption | Transactions implemented (1.6a) | ✅ Resolved |
| Testing Debt | Framework established early (1.3) | ✅ Resolved |
| Security Vulnerabilities | Packages updated (1.11) | ✅ Resolved |

### ⚠️ Current Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Plan |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Performance Issues | Medium | Story 1.7 & 1.14 address this |
| UI Complexity | Medium | Epic 2 with iterative approach |
| Template Security | Low | Epic 3 includes security sandbox |

## Quality Metrics

### Test Coverage
- **Current Coverage**: Data pending from Story 1.12
- **Target Coverage**: 80% overall, 90% core
- **Mutation Score**: Baseline established

### Code Quality
- **Linting**: ✅ ESLint configured
- **Type Safety**: ✅ TypeScript strict mode
- **DI Pattern**: ✅ Implemented

## Team Notes

### What's Working Well
- Foundation stories completed ahead of internal estimates
- TUI spike successful - no pivot needed
- Testing infrastructure solid
- Team momentum strong

### Areas for Improvement
- Need to complete Epic 1 before moving to Epic 2
- Performance monitoring should be prioritized
- Documentation needs continuous updates

## Recommendations

1. **Complete Epic 1** before starting Epic 2 in full
2. **Prioritize Performance** (Stories 1.7 and 1.14)
3. **Begin Epic 2 Planning** while finishing Epic 1
4. **Update Documentation** as stories complete
5. **Consider Parallel Work** on Epic 3 templates

## Conclusion

The project is progressing well with 27.5% of stories complete and all critical infrastructure in place. The successful TUI spike (Story 1.4) means the project can proceed as originally planned without needing the CLI-only fallback option. With 13 of 20 Epic 1 stories complete, the foundation is solid for moving into the UI implementation phase.

**Next Review Date**: After Epic 1 completion (estimated 1-2 weeks)
