    title: Cross-platform terminal behavior differences
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - Implement comprehensive testing matrix across all target terminals
      - Create terminal-specific behavior normalization layer
      - Validate capability detection meets <5ms performance budget
      - Establish robust visual regression testing framework
    monitor:
      - Capability detection timing and memory usage
      - Cross-terminal compatibility issues in production
      - Visual regression test pass rates
      - User-reported terminal problems
    considerations:
      - Leverage existing capability detection system (70% complete)
      - Focus testing efforts on cross-platform compatibility
      - Implement performance optimization early in development
      - Create comprehensive documentation for supported terminals
