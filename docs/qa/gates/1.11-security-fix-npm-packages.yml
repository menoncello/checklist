  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Successfully removed chalk from direct dependencies. Transitive dependencies still contain compromised packages via dev dependencies (lint-staged), which poses lower risk.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Ansis provides equivalent or better performance than chalk. No performance regression observed.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'All 500 tests pass. Migration command works correctly with new color library.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'ESLint rules added to prevent reintroduction. Security tests monitor for compromised packages.'
