notes: |
  Comprehensive review completed after QA fixes. The Schema Migration System demonstrates
  excellent implementation quality with all critical risks mitigated through extensive
  testing. Path traversal vulnerability has been fixed and validated. Performance meets
  all requirements with <500ms for typical migrations. The system is production-ready
  with robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.
