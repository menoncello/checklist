  security:
    status: PASS
    score: 95
    notes: |
      Excellent security implementation with three-layer sandbox validation (regex → globals → AST).
      All 3 critical security risks (SEC-001, SEC-002, SEC-003) fully mitigated with comprehensive testing.
      - Sandbox escape protection: AST parsing with acorn, frozen context, blocked globals
      - Template injection prevention: Schema validation, variable sanitization, expression validation
      - Path traversal protection: Path validation, directory restriction, file type enforcement
      - Resource exhaustion prevention: Timeout, memory limits, CPU monitoring, AbortController
      40+ security-focused tests validate protection against known attack patterns.

  performance:
    status: PASS
    score: 85
    notes: |
      Good performance design with optimizations in place. Minor gap: no benchmark tests yet.
      Design meets all performance targets:
      - Template loading: <50ms (optimized with Bun.file())
      - Cache hit: <5ms (LRU Map with O(1) operations)
      - Memory baseline: <50MB (enforced by limits)
      - Sandbox execution: <5000ms (enforced by timeout)
      - Startup: <100ms (lazy loading supported)
      Performance optimizations: LRU cache, AST skip for simple expressions, Bun.file() I/O, cache-first architecture.
      Recommendation: Add performance benchmarks in future iteration to validate SLAs.

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    score: 98
    notes: |
      Excellent reliability with comprehensive error handling and recovery strategies.
      8 specialized error classes provide structured context and actionable recovery guidance.
      Resource cleanup in all paths (finally blocks, AbortController).
      351 lines of error handling tests validate reliability.
      Timeout handling, concurrent operations tested, graceful degradation implemented.
      Minor enhancement opportunity: Circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures (low priority).

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    score: 95
    notes: |
      Excellent code organization and maintainability. Clean architecture with separation of concerns.
      10 well-defined modules, dependency injection, single responsibility principle.
      Type-safe interfaces with zero `any` types. Comprehensive documentation (718 lines).
      214 tests (100% passing) with excellent organization.
      Code refactored to meet standards: function length, complexity, nesting depth all compliant.
      Integration tests cover all 7 scenarios from story.
      File sizes mostly compliant (one justified exception for security complexity).
