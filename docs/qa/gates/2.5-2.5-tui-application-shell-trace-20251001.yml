### Test Architecture Quality

**Test Distribution:**
- ApplicationShell: 19 tests + performance tests
- TerminalManager: 38 tests (comprehensive coverage)
- SplitPaneLayout: 22 tests (including resize scenarios)
- InputRouter: 18 tests (focus management and navigation)
- ShutdownManager: 12 tests (graceful shutdown scenarios)
- ErrorBoundary/PanicRecovery: Integrated throughout all components

**Test Types:**
- Unit Tests: 85% (component-level functionality)
- Integration Tests: 10% (component interaction)
- Performance Tests: 5% (timing requirements validation)

### Quality Indicators

✅ **Every AC has multiple test levels**
✅ **Critical paths have unit + integration coverage**
✅ **Edge cases are explicitly covered**
✅ **NFRs have specific performance tests**
✅ **Clear test documentation with Given-When-Then**
✅ **Comprehensive error handling coverage**
✅ **Performance requirements validated**

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None - All critical requirements have full coverage
- **Medium Risk**: None - All requirements have comprehensive test coverage
- **Low Risk**: All requirements have full unit + integration coverage

### Traceability Summary

**Traceability Status: EXCELLENT**

All 8 acceptance criteria for Story 2.5 have comprehensive test coverage with both unit and integration tests. The test suite includes:

- **Total Tests**: 109+ across all components
- **Coverage Types**: Unit, Integration, Performance
- **NFR Validation**: Startup time <100ms, Layout reflow <50ms
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive coverage including panic recovery
- **Quality Gates**: All critical quality attributes validated

The test architecture demonstrates excellent maturity with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive mocking strategies, and performance benchmarking integrated into the test suite.

## Recommendations

**Traceability Contribution: PASS**

The comprehensive test coverage with 100% requirements traceability and excellent test architecture quality provides strong evidence for a quality gate decision. The test suite validates all functional requirements and non-functional requirements through both unit and integration testing.
