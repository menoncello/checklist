  Quality enforcement infrastructure is well-implemented with comprehensive ESLint
  integration, CI/CD pipeline enforcement, and pre-commit hooks. However, significant
  refactoring work remains incomplete across TUI, CLI, and Shared packages with 40+
  files still violating the new quality metrics.

findings:
  strengths:
    - ESLint configuration properly implemented with all required quality rules
    - CI/CD pipeline integration working with quality report generation
    - Pre-commit hooks successfully blocking violations locally
    - Core package partially refactored with maintained test coverage
    - Quality scripts properly integrated into existing workflow

  concerns:
    - Major refactoring backlog: 40+ files across 3 packages still exceed 300-line limit
    - No automated validation of CI pipeline failure behavior
    - Report content validation missing
    - Performance impact of quality rules not measured

  blockers: []

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - Complete TUI package refactoring (17 files over limit)
    - Complete CLI package refactoring analysis
    - Complete Shared package refactoring analysis
    - Add automated CI failure validation test

  future:
    - Implement report content validation tests
    - Add quality metrics to performance monitoring
    - Create quality trend analysis automation
    - Document exemption process for edge cases

test_coverage:

    gaps: 'Report validation tests needed'

  e2e_tests:

    quality: 'good'
    gaps: 'Complete developer workflow validation needed'

risk_assessment:
  high_risk:
    - 'Incomplete refactoring may cause CI failures when rules are enabled'
    - 'Large refactoring could introduce regressions without proper testing'

  medium_risk:
    - 'CI pipeline might allow violations if misconfigured'
    - 'Performance impact of new rules unknown'

  low_risk:
    - 'Report generation reliability'
    - 'Pre-commit hook effectiveness'

technical_debt:
  current:
    - 'ServiceBindings.ts successfully refactored (346 → 15 lines)'
    - 'Quality metrics temporarily disabled in ESLint config'

  accumulated:
    - '40+ files exceeding 300-line limit across packages'
    - 'Missing automated validation for quality enforcement'
    - 'Incomplete test coverage for report generation'

nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Pre-commit secret detection, ESLint security rules, dependency scanning implemented'
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Quality rule execution overhead unmeasured, large files cause processing delays'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Graceful degradation, error recovery, and CI integration properly implemented'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Quality enforcement directly improves long-term maintainability and code structure'

next_actions:
  - 'Enable quality rules in ESLint config after refactoring'
  - 'Complete package-by-package refactoring'
  - 'Add missing validation tests'
  - 'Measure performance impact of quality rules'
