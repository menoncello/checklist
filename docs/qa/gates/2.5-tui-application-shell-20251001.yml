# Gate Decision
gate_decision: "CONCERNS"
quality_score: 70

# Decision Rationale
decision_rationale: >
  The implementation demonstrates excellent architectural design with comprehensive test coverage (109 tests) and all 8 acceptance criteria properly mapped to tests. However, critical code quality issues prevent deployment:
  - 80+ TypeScript errors across components and tests
  - 6 ESLint violations including max-lines and type safety issues
  - File size violations affecting maintainability
  - Test API alignment issues requiring fixes

# Review Summary
review_summary: >
  Story 2.5: TUI Application Shell demonstrates excellent architectural design with comprehensive test coverage (109 tests) and proper implementation of all 8 acceptance criteria. The implementation includes robust error handling, panic recovery, terminal management, and performance monitoring that meet all functional and non-functional requirements.

  However, critical code quality issues prevent deployment. The implementation has 80+ TypeScript errors, 6 ESLint violations, and file size violations that must be addressed. These issues primarily involve type safety, interface alignment, and code complexity rather than fundamental architectural problems.

  The gate decision is CONCERNS with a quality score of 70/100. All functional requirements are met, but code quality standards are not. The team should resolve the identified issues before this story can be marked as done.
