decision: "PASS"
rationale: |
  Story 2.5 demonstrates exceptional requirements traceability with 100% coverage of all acceptance criteria.
  The test suite provides comprehensive validation of both functional and non-functional requirements,
  with explicit performance benchmarking and thorough error scenario testing. All 8 acceptance criteria
  are fully mapped to specific test cases using Given-When-Then patterns, providing complete confidence
  that the TUI Application Shell implementation meets all requirements.

next_steps:
  - No immediate actions required for traceability
  - Consider implementing recommended enhancement tests for future iterations
  - Maintain current testing standards for subsequent stories
