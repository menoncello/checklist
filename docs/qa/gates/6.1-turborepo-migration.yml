# Final gate decision
decision:
  gate: PASS
  confidence: HIGH
  rationale: |
    Story 6.1 demonstrates exemplary quality across all dimensions:

    1. Risk Mitigation: All critical and high risks addressed through automated testing
       - TECH-001 (Critical): Mitigated via dependency chain tests
       - OPS-001, PERF-001, DATA-001 (High): All mitigated with comprehensive tests

    2. Test Coverage: Excellent coverage with 18 new automated tests (100% passing)
       - Performance benchmarks validate all targets
       - Cache behavior validated across all scenarios
       - Dependency chains prevent misconfiguration

    3. NFR Compliance: All four core NFRs pass with strong evidence
       - Security: Proper secret management, no new attack surface
       - Performance: All targets met, automated validation prevents regression
       - Reliability: Comprehensive rollback plan, error handling tested
       - Maintainability: Test coverage maintained, exceptional documentation

    4. Implementation Quality: Zero source code changes, configuration-only approach
       - Clean migration preserves existing architecture
       - No technical debt introduced
       - 100% backward compatibility (all existing tests pass)

    5. Documentation: Comprehensive developer resources (7 major sections)
       - Command reference, concepts, best practices, troubleshooting
       - IDE integration, rollback procedures, quick reference cheat sheet

    The only remaining gap is hot reload verification (AC5 - P2 non-blocking), which has
    validated configuration but unautomated runtime behavior. This is acceptable as the
    configuration is correct and hot reload is binary (works or fails completely).

    Recommendation: APPROVED FOR MERGE

  blocking_issues: []

  non_blocking_concerns:
    - issue: "Hot reload verification (AC5)"
      severity: P2
      status: "Configuration validated, runtime testing deferred"
      recommendation: "Manual spot check or post-merge enhancement"
      impact: "Low - configuration correct, low regression probability"

  next_steps:
    - "Merge to main branch"
    - "Monitor build performance in production"
    - "Track cache hit rates post-deployment"
    - "Collect developer feedback during first week"
    - "Optional: Manual hot reload validation"
    - "Optional: Performance monitoring dashboard setup"
