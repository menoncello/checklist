# Summary
summary: |
  Story 1.12 successfully implements StrykerJS mutation testing infrastructure with innovative
  Bun integration via command runner. The core functionality is operational with excellent
  performance optimization and reliability features. 
  
  Primary concerns are:
  1. Current mutation score (62.32%) falls short of 85% threshold
  2. Dashboard integration pending token configuration
  
  These are addressable issues requiring focused effort on test quality improvements
  rather than infrastructure changes. The implementation demonstrates strong technical
  design and is production-ready once test coverage improvements are completed.
