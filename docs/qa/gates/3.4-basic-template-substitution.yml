# Decision Rationale
decision_rationale: |
  Story 3.4 demonstrates exemplary implementation quality across all evaluation criteria:

  1. Requirements Coverage: 100% - All 8 acceptance criteria fully traced to comprehensive tests
  2. Security: PASS - No eval/injection vulnerabilities, pattern validation enforced, 14 security tests
  3. Performance: PASS - Critical <5ms target exceeded (AC8), 6 benchmarks validating all tiers
  4. Reliability: PASS - Comprehensive error handling with fuzzy matching, graceful degradation
  5. Maintainability: PASS - 95+ tests, modular design, ESLint compliant, full documentation

  The integration test gap identified in the previous assessment (2025-10-10) has been resolved
  with the addition of comprehensive integration tests covering VariableStore → Substitution
  workflows. No blocking or concerning issues remain.

  Quality Score: 100/100
  Risk Level: Very Low
  Gate Decision: PASS

  Recommendation: Ready for completion and merge to main branch.
