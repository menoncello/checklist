summary: |
  Story 2.6 Terminal Compatibility Suite demonstrates exceptional implementation quality
  with comprehensive terminal support, robust error handling, and excellent test coverage.
  All 8 acceptance criteria are fully implemented and validated. Minor maintainability
  concerns (file size) do not impact functionality and can be addressed post-release.

conclusion: |
  Story 2.6 Terminal Compatibility Suite is APPROVED for release with high confidence.

  The implementation exceeds requirements in most areas:
  - 100% acceptance criteria coverage
  - 100% test coverage for all requirements
  - 8+ terminals supported (double the requirement)
  - Performance targets exceeded (<5ms detection)
  - Robust security controls implemented

  Minor technical debt (file size) can be addressed post-release without risk.
  The terminal compatibility system is production-ready and will provide excellent
  user experience across diverse terminal environments.
