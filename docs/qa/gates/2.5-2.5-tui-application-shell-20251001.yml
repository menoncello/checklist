review_summary: |
  This comprehensive review reveals excellent functional implementation with all 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested. The architecture demonstrates strong separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and proper performance monitoring. However, critical code quality issues prevent deployment readiness.

  Key Findings:
  - All functional requirements met with 100% requirements traceability
  - 109+ tests across all components with comprehensive coverage
  - Security, performance, and reliability NFRs fully satisfied
  - Critical maintainability issues with 390 TypeScript errors
  - Code quality violations requiring immediate attention

  The implementation provides a strong foundation for production deployment after resolving the critical code quality issues.
