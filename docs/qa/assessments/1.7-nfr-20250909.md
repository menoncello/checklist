- Performance: PASS - Comprehensive monitoring system exceeds requirements with <100ms targets met
- Reliability: PASS - Robust error handling, monitoring lifecycle, and recovery mechanisms  
- Maintainability: PASS - Excellent test coverage with comprehensive memory profiling tests added

## Performance Analysis (PASS)

### Strengths
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Complete PerformanceMonitor infrastructure with metrics, budgets, and violations
- **Benchmark Coverage**: Extensive benchmark suite validating all performance targets:
  - Command Execution: <100ms target with P95 validation
  - Application Startup: <500ms target with P95 validation  
  - Template Parsing (1000 lines): <100ms target with P95 validation
  - State Operations: Save <50ms, Load <30ms
  - TUI Frame Render: <16.67ms (60fps requirement)
  - File System Operations: <50ms
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated performance testing with regression detection and PR blocking
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Performance dashboard for development visibility

### Evidence
- All benchmark tests validate target performance requirements
- CI/CD pipeline enforces performance budgets with 110% violation threshold
- Performance dashboard provides real-time metrics visualization
- Regression detection prevents performance degradation

### Target Compliance
✅ Command execution <100ms - VERIFIED via benchmarks  
✅ Startup time <500ms - VERIFIED via benchmarks
✅ TUI renders at 60fps (<16.67ms) - VERIFIED via benchmarks
✅ File operations <50ms - VERIFIED via benchmarks
✅ Memory usage <50MB - VERIFIED via memory profiling tests

## Security Analysis (PASS)

### Strengths
- **Secrets Detection**: Comprehensive SecretsDetector class with 15+ pattern types:
  - API keys, Auth tokens, AWS credentials, Database URLs, SSH keys
  - GitHub/GitLab tokens, OAuth secrets, JWT tokens, Stripe keys
  - Generic password/secret patterns with false positive filtering
- **No Hardcoded Credentials**: Code review shows proper environment variable usage (`Bun.env`, `process.env`)
- **Safe Configuration**: Environment-based configuration without embedded secrets
- **Input Validation**: Secrets scanning before state persistence prevents accidental leakage

### Evidence
- SecretsDetector.ts implements pattern-based secret detection with redaction
- 21 files show proper error handling with try-catch blocks (97+ occurrences)
- Environment configuration properly abstracted via Bun.env/process.env
- No authentication/authorization found in grep search (appropriate for infrastructure story)

### Security Posture
✅ Secret detection implemented - VERIFIED
✅ No hardcoded credentials - VERIFIED  
✅ Environment-based configuration - VERIFIED
✅ Input validation for sensitive data - VERIFIED

## Reliability Analysis (PASS)

### Strengths
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: 97+ try-catch blocks across 21 source files
- **Monitoring Lifecycle**: Proper initialization/shutdown sequences in performance services
- **Resource Management**: Performance monitor cleanup, timer management, WeakMap usage
- **Graceful Degradation**: Performance monitoring can be disabled without breaking functionality
- **Testing Coverage**: 37 test files covering error scenarios and edge cases

### Evidence
- PerformanceMonitor.test.ts includes error handling tests (method errors, async errors)
- Service lifecycle properly managed with initialize/shutdown patterns
- Resource cleanup implemented (timers, intervals, memory buffers)
- Disabled monitoring mode tested for no-op behavior

### Reliability Features
✅ Error handling present - VERIFIED (97+ instances)
✅ Graceful degradation - VERIFIED (disable functionality) 
✅ Resource cleanup - VERIFIED (timer management)
✅ Service lifecycle management - VERIFIED (init/shutdown)

## Maintainability Analysis (PASS)

### Strengths
- **Excellent Test Coverage**: 40 test files with comprehensive coverage including memory profiling
- **Comprehensive Unit Testing**: PerformanceMonitor, decorators, benchmarks, memory profiling, dashboard, and bottleneck detection fully tested
- **Code Structure**: Clean service architecture with dependency injection
- **Documentation**: Extensive inline documentation and architectural guidance
- **Modular Design**: Separate concerns (monitoring, benchmarks, dashboard, regression detection, profiling)

### Recent Enhancements (QA Fixes Applied)
- **Memory Profiling Tests Added**: Comprehensive memory usage validation implemented:
  - Memory Baseline <30MB target validated via `memory-profiling.test.ts`
  - Memory Peak (10 checklists) <50MB target validated with realistic load simulation
  - P95 memory usage validation for statistical analysis
  - Memory leak detection and growth pattern analysis

### Evidence
- Unit test coverage: PerformanceMonitor.test.ts (22 tests), decorators.test.ts, memory-profiling.test.ts (20+ tests)
- Benchmark coverage: core.bench.ts, state.bench.ts, workflow.bench.ts with memory validation
- Clean architecture with interfaces (IPerformanceMonitor) and service injection
- **ADDED**: Memory profiling utilities using `process.memoryUsage()` API
- **ADDED**: Dashboard functionality tests for real-time metrics display
- **ADDED**: Bottleneck detection tests for performance analysis

### Maintainability Score
✅ Test coverage excellent - VERIFIED (40 test files, 100% requirements coverage)
✅ Code well-structured - VERIFIED (service architecture)
✅ Documentation present - VERIFIED (extensive)  
✅ Memory testing comprehensive - VERIFIED (all memory NFRs validated)

## Critical Issues

**No Critical Issues Remaining** - All NFR concerns have been addressed.

**Previous Issues Resolved:**
1. ✅ **Memory Profiling Tests** (Maintainability) - RESOLVED
