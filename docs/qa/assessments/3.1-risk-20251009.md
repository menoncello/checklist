**Story:** 3.1 - Template Loading with Sandbox

## Executive Summary

- **Total Risks Identified:** 12
- **Critical Risks:** 3
- **High Risks:** 4
- **Medium Risks:** 3
- **Low Risks:** 2
- **Risk Score:** 31/100 (High Risk Implementation)

This story involves implementing a template loading system with security sandboxing, which inherently carries significant security and performance risks. The combination of user-provided templates, dynamic execution, and resource management creates multiple attack surfaces that require careful mitigation.

---

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Sandbox Escape Vulnerabilities

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability:** High (3) - Sandboxing JavaScript/TypeScript is notoriously difficult; many implementations have had escape vulnerabilities.
**Impact:** High (3) - Successful escape could allow arbitrary code execution, system compromise, data exfiltration.

**Description:**
Template sandbox may contain vulnerabilities allowing malicious templates to break out of the sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the host system. Attack vectors include prototype pollution, accessing hidden globals, exploiting AST parser weaknesses, or leveraging Bun runtime internals.

**Affected Components:**
- `packages/core/src/templates/TemplateSandbox.ts`
- AST parsing and validation logic
- Sandbox context creation

**Mitigation:**
- Implement comprehensive AST validation to detect dangerous patterns before execution
- Use Object.freeze() on all sandbox globals and prototypes
- Block access to constructor, __proto__, prototype properties
- Implement allowlist approach (only permit safe operations) vs blocklist
- Perform thorough security testing with known sandbox escape techniques
- Consider using Bun's isolated contexts if available
- Implement defense-in-depth: even if sandbox escapes, limit process permissions

**Testing Requirements:**
- Security tests with OWASP testing framework
- Attempt known JavaScript sandbox escape techniques
- Fuzzing with malicious template payloads
- Penetration testing by security specialist
- Test prototype pollution attacks
- Test global access bypasses (process, require, eval, Function)
- Test constructor chain exploits

**Residual Risk:** Medium - Some zero-day sandbox escape techniques may exist

**Owner:** Development Team + Security Review
**Timeline:** Before any deployment to environments with untrusted templates

---

### 2. SEC-002: Template Injection Attacks

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability:** High (3) - Templates accept user input and perform variable substitution, classic injection vector.
**Impact:** High (3) - Could lead to command injection, XSS, or arbitrary code execution.

**Description:**
Malicious actors could craft templates with injection payloads that execute unintended code when templates are processed. This includes injecting shell commands, JavaScript code, or exploiting template syntax to bypass validation.

**Affected Components:**
- `packages/core/src/templates/TemplateLoader.ts`
- Variable substitution logic
- Command execution in steps
- Template inheritance merging

**Mitigation:**
- Strict input validation for all template fields
- Parameterized execution for commands (avoid shell string concatenation)
- Escape/sanitize all user-provided content before substitution
- Validate template expressions for dangerous patterns
- Use content security policies for template content
- Implement template signing/verification for trusted sources
- Audit all template merging logic for injection points

**Testing Requirements:**
- Injection testing with payloads: `$(whoami)`, `; rm -rf /`, `${process.exit(1)}`
- Test variable substitution with malicious content
- Test command injection in step commands
- Test template inheritance with malicious parent templates
- Test metadata injection attacks

**Residual Risk:** Low - With proper validation and parameterization

**Owner:** Development Team
**Timeline:** Must be addressed before first release

### 3. SEC-003: Path Traversal in Template Loading

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability:** Medium (3) - Template loading from filesystem could be exploited if not properly validated.
**Impact:** High (3) - Could allow reading arbitrary files, loading malicious templates from unexpected locations.

**Description:**

**Affected Components:**
- `packages/core/src/templates/TemplateLoader.ts`
- Template discovery logic
- Template inheritance resolution

**Mitigation:**
- Canonicalize all file paths and validate they're within allowed directory

- Blocklist dangerous path patterns (`..`, absolute paths, symlinks)
- Implement strict file type validation (.yaml only)
- Use Bun.file() with explicit path validation
- Restrict file system access to read-only for template directory
- Log all template loading attempts with paths for audit

**Testing Requirements:**
- Path traversal tests: `../`, `../../`, absolute paths
- Test symlink handling
- Test template inheritance with invalid paths
- Test with URL-encoded and Unicode path tricks
- Test loading from outside `/templates` directory

**Residual Risk:** Low - With proper path validation and canonicalization

## Conclusion

This story represents a **HIGH RISK implementation** with a risk score of **31/100** due to the inherent security challenges of sandboxing and executing user-provided templates. The three critical security risks (SEC-001, SEC-002, SEC-003) must be fully addressed and verified before any production deployment.

### Gate Mapping Decision

Based on the deterministic gate mapping rules:
- 3 risks with score ≥ 9 (critical)
- **Gate Decision:** → **FAIL** (until critical risks mitigated and verified)

### Path to PASS Gate

To achieve a **PASS** gate, the following must be completed:

1. ✅ All critical security risks (SEC-001, SEC-002, SEC-003) fully mitigated
2. ✅ Security testing completed with no critical vulnerabilities found
3. ✅ Security expert review and sign-off obtained
4. ✅ All high-risk items (PERF-001, DATA-001, TECH-001, SEC-004) addressed with tests
5. ✅ Resource limiting fully implemented and tested
6. ✅ Monitoring and alerting configured
7. ✅ Incident response procedures documented

### Recommended Quality Bar

Given the security-critical nature of this story, I recommend:

- **Target Test Coverage:** 100% for all template security components
- **Mutation Testing:** 95%+ for sandbox and validation code
- **Security Testing:** Mandatory penetration testing before production
- **Performance Testing:** Comprehensive load and stress testing
- **Documentation:** Complete threat model and security architecture documentation

**Review Status:** Risk profile will be integrated into quality gate assessment.

---

**Next Steps:**

1. Review this risk profile with security team
2. Adjust implementation plan to address critical risks first
3. Allocate adequate time for security testing
4. Schedule security expert review before deployment
5. Integrate risk monitoring into production environment
