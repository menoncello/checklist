Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 12
- Critical Risks: 2
- High Risks: 3
- Medium Risks: 4
- Low Risks: 3
- **Risk Score: 21/100** (High Risk - Immediate attention required)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Wrong TUI Approach Selection
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Spike is exploring unproven approaches, selection criteria may miss critical factors
**Impact**: High - Wrong choice blocks entire UI implementation (1.8, 1.9), forces major rework
**Mitigation**:
- Strict adherence to 100-point scoring rubric
- Test all three approaches thoroughly
- Document all findings transparently
- Have CLI fallback ready as per mitigation plan
**Testing Focus**: Performance benchmarks, cross-platform compatibility matrix, memory profiling

### 2. TECH-002: Bun Runtime Incompatibility
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Bun is relatively new, many Node.js TUI libraries untested with Bun
**Impact**: High - Could force runtime change affecting entire project architecture
**Mitigation**:
- Test each approach specifically with Bun 1.1.x
- Verify native module compatibility
- Test Bun-specific APIs (Bun.env, etc.)
- Document any Bun-specific workarounds needed
**Testing Focus**: Runtime compatibility tests, native binding tests, performance under Bun

## High Risk Areas

### 3. PERF-001: Performance Requirements Not Met
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Ambitious targets (<50ms startup, <100ms render)
**Impact**: High - Failure means poor user experience, potential project failure
**Mitigation**:
- Use Tinybench for accurate micro-benchmarks
- Test with realistic data volumes (1000+ items)
- Profile memory usage continuously
- Consider performance degradation over time

### 4. TECH-003: Cross-Platform Terminal Incompatibility
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Terminal capabilities vary significantly
**Impact**: High - Users on unsupported platforms cannot use the tool
**Mitigation**:
- Test on actual terminals, not just emulators
- Include SSH session testing
- Test tmux/screen compatibility
- Document minimum terminal requirements

### 5. OPS-001: Insufficient Spike Documentation
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - 3-day timebox pressures may rush documentation
**Impact**: High - Poor decisions based on incomplete data
**Mitigation**:
- Use structured templates for results
- Capture raw benchmark data
- Screenshot visual tests
- Document failed approaches thoroughly

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Bun Compatibility Suite**
  - Test each TUI approach with Bun 1.1.x
  - Verify native module loading
  - Check for memory leaks specific to Bun
  - Test Bun.env and other Bun-specific APIs

- **Performance Benchmark Suite**
  - Startup time measurement (target <50ms)
  - Render performance with 1000 items (target <100ms)
  - Memory usage monitoring (target <50MB)
  - FPS measurement during scrolling

- **Cross-Platform Matrix**
  - macOS: Terminal.app, iTerm2
  - Linux: GNOME Terminal, xterm
  - Windows: Windows Terminal, PowerShell
  - SSH sessions, tmux, screen

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Stress Testing**
  - Large dataset rendering (10,000+ items)
  - Rapid keyboard input handling
  - Continuous terminal resizing
  - Long-running session stability

- **Integration Testing**
  - Test with actual checklist data structures
  - Verify with TestWorkspace setup
  - Ensure compatibility with testing framework (node-pty)

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Visual Testing**
  - Snapshot tests for each approach
  - Flicker detection
  - Color/theme support validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Proceeding
- Score <50 on rubric = MUST implement CLI fallback
- Any approach causing Bun crashes = Eliminate immediately
- Memory usage >100MB = Unacceptable

### Can Proceed with Mitigation
- Score 50-74 = Implement hybrid approach
- Minor platform incompatibilities = Document workarounds
- Performance slightly off target = Plan optimization sprint

### Accepted Risks
- Some terminal emulators may have minor visual issues
- Initial version may not support all accessibility features

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-spike monitoring needs:
- Performance regression tests in CI/CD
- Memory leak detection in long-running tests
- Cross-platform compatibility in build matrix
- User feedback on TUI responsiveness

## Risk Review Triggers

Re-evaluate risks if:
- Bun version changes significantly
- New terminal emulator requirements emerge
- Performance requirements change
- Alternative TUI libraries become available
- Team discovers blocking issues during implementation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Set up comprehensive test harness first** - Don't start implementation without proper measurement tools
2. **Test Bun compatibility early** - This is a potential showstopper
3. **Create fallback plan artifacts** - Have CLI implementation ready if TUI fails

### Testing Priority
1. Bun runtime compatibility (Critical)
2. Performance benchmarks (Critical)
3. Cross-platform testing (High)
4. Memory profiling (High)
5. Visual testing (Medium)

### Development Focus
- Prioritize measurable metrics over subjective quality
- Document every failure and workaround
- Keep code modular for easy approach switching
- Maintain strict 3-day timebox

### Deployment Strategy
- Use feature flags for TUI vs CLI mode
- Prepare rollback to CLI if issues discovered
- Consider beta testing with subset of users
- Monitor performance metrics in production

## Risk Score Calculation

```
Base Score: 100
- Critical risks (2 × 20): -40
- High risks (3 × 10): -30
- Medium risks (4 × 5): -20
- Low risks (3 × 2): -6
Final Score: 21/100 (High Risk)
```

## Decision Framework Impact

Given the risk profile:
- **Score 75+**: Low risk, proceed with confidence
- **Score 50-74**: Moderate risk, implement with caution
- **Score <50**: High risk, strong CLI fallback required

Current score of **21** indicates this spike carries significant technical risk. The CLI fallback plan is essential, not optional.
