#### AC5: Quality metrics integrated into existing ESLint configuration

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Configuration Integration**: `eslint.config.js::lines 89-96`
  - **Given**: Existing ESLint flat config structure at line 89
  - **When**: Quality metrics are added after existing rules
  - **Then**: Quality rules are integrated without breaking existing configuration

- **Script Integration**: `tests/quality/report-validation.test.ts::Quality report integration with existing scripts`
  - **Given**: Package.json with existing lint scripts
  - **When**: lint:report script is added

- **Workflow Integration**: `bun run quality` command execution
  - **Given**: Existing quality script that runs lint, format:check, typecheck
  - **When**: Quality metrics rules are enabled
  - **Then**: New rules are enforced through existing workflow

#### AC6: CI/CD pipeline fails when quality thresholds are exceeded

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Reason: ESLint failure simulation tested, but no actual CI pipeline failure validation

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **ESLint Failure Test**: `tests/quality/ci-validation.test.ts::GitHub Actions pipeline would fail with enabled quality rules and violations`
  - **Given**: File with intentional quality violations and enabled quality rules
  - **When**: ESLint runs with quality-enabled configuration
  - **Then**: ESLint exits with non-zero code proving CI would fail

- **Local Simulation**: `tests/quality/ci-validation.test.ts::Pre-commit hook should block commits with quality violations`
  - **Given**: Quality violations in code
  - **When**: Pre-commit quality check runs
  - **Then**: Process fails with non-zero exit code

**Gap**: No test validates actual GitHub Actions pipeline failure behavior in CI environment

#### AC7: Detailed quality reports generated for each violation

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Reason: HTML report generation working, but content completeness not fully validated

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Report Generation**: `tests/quality/ci-validation.test.ts::Quality report generation should produce valid HTML output`
  - **Given**: Current codebase with potential violations
  - **When**: `bun run lint:report` command executes
  - **Then**: Valid HTML report is generated at reports/quality/eslint-report.html

- **Report Structure**: `tests/quality/report-validation.test.ts::HTML report should contain proper structure and styling`
  - **Given**: Generated ESLint HTML report
  - **When**: Report content is analyzed
  - **Then**: Report contains valid HTML, CSS styling, and ESLint branding

- **Zero Violations Handling**: `tests/quality/report-validation.test.ts::Report should handle zero violations gracefully`
  - **Given**: Codebase with no violations
  - **When**: Report generation runs
  - **Then**: Report produces valid HTML without crashing

- **Comprehensive Validation**: `tests/quality/report-validation.test.ts::HTML report contains accurate violation details for different violation types`
  - **Given**: File with specific quality violations (max-params, max-depth, complexity, etc.)
  - **When**: HTML report is generated with quality rules enabled
  - **Then**: Report accurately shows violation types, line numbers, and error details

**Gap**: No validation of report content accuracy or completeness across all violation scenarios in production environment

#### AC8: Existing code refactored to meet new quality standards

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Reason: Core package ServiceBindings.ts refactored (346â†’15 lines), but 40+ files across TUI/CLI/Shared packages remain

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Core Package Refactoring**: Manual validation with test suite verification
  - **Given**: ServiceBindings.ts with 346 lines violating quality limits
  - **When**: File is refactored into 5 modular binding files
  - **Then**: Core package passes all tests and reduces to 15 lines

- **Test Suite Validation**: All core package tests continue passing
  - **Given**: Refactored core package code structure
  - **When**: Full test suite runs (`bun test packages/core`)
  - **Then**: 796 tests execute with 765 passing, 31 skipped (no failures)

- **Progressive Refactoring Plan**: `docs/quality-refactoring-plan.md`
  - **Given**: Identified 47 files exceeding quality thresholds across packages
  - **When**: Systematic refactoring approach is applied
  - **Then**: Quality standards are met package by package

**Gap**: Major refactoring backlog prevents quality rules activation - 40+ files remain across TUI/CLI/Shared packages

#### AC9: Pre-commit hooks validate quality metrics locally

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Hook Configuration**: `.husky/pre-commit` already configured
  - **Given**: Existing pre-commit hook running `bun run quality`
  - **When**: Quality command includes ESLint execution
  - **Then**: Quality violations are caught before commit

- **Local Blocking**: `tests/quality/ci-validation.test.ts::Pre-commit hook should block commits with quality violations`
  - **Given**: File with quality violations added to git staging
  - **When**: Commit attempt triggers pre-commit hook
  - **Then**: Commit is blocked with non-zero exit code

- **Performance Validation**: Hook execution time measured
  - **Given**: Pre-commit hook running full quality checks
  - **When**: `time bun run quality` is executed
  - **Then**: Execution completes in <5 seconds maintaining developer productivity

### Critical Gaps

1. **CI Pipeline Failure Validation (AC6)**
   - **Gap**: No test validates actual GitHub Actions pipeline failure behavior
   - **Risk**: High - Could allow violations through if CI misconfigured
   - **Action**: Add end-to-end CI pipeline test or environment-specific validation

2. **Report Content Completeness (AC7)**
   - **Gap**: Report content validation limited to structure, not comprehensive accuracy
   - **Risk**: Low - Report generation working but content completeness uncertain
   - **Action**: Expand test coverage for edge cases and violation type completeness

3. **Massive Refactoring Backlog (AC8)**
   - **Gap**: 40+ files across 3 packages still violate quality metrics
   - **Risk**: High - Rules cannot be enabled until refactoring complete
   - **Action**: Execute systematic package-by-package refactoring plan

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **CI Pipeline End-to-End Test**
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow test that validates pipeline failure
   - Use test environment or branch-specific rules to validate behavior
   - Mock quality violations and verify pipeline stops

2. **Report Content Accuracy Tests**
   - Expand violation type coverage in report validation tests
   - Test edge cases (empty files, comment-only files, mixed violation types)
   - Validate report accuracy against known violation counts

3. **Refactoring Validation Tests**
   - Add mutation testing validation after each package refactoring
   - Performance regression tests to ensure refactoring doesn't impact runtime
   - Integration tests between refactored components

4. **Quality Rules Gradual Enablement Tests**
   - Tests for package-specific quality rule activation
   - Validation that partial enablement works correctly
   - Rollback procedures if quality activation breaks CI

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: AC8 incomplete refactoring prevents full quality enforcement
- **High Risk**: AC6 CI failure behavior not validated in actual pipeline
- **Medium Risk**: AC7 report content accuracy limitations
- **Low Risk**: Infrastructure and configuration working correctly

### Test Coverage Quality Indicators

**Strong Coverage Indicators:**
- Every AC has concrete test mappings using Given-When-Then
- Multiple test levels (unit, integration, system) for critical ACs
- Configuration changes validated through automated tests
- Manual validation supported by automated test suite

**Areas for Improvement:**
- End-to-end CI pipeline validation needed
- More comprehensive report content validation required
- Refactoring progress needs measurable validation criteria

**Test Granularity Analysis:**
- **Unit Level**: ESLint rule configuration and violation detection
- **Integration Level**: Quality script workflow and report generation
- **System Level**: Pre-commit hooks and CI pipeline integration
- **Manual Level**: Refactoring validation and developer workflow

### Integration with Quality Gates

This traceability analysis supports the following gate decision:

- **Critical gaps (AC8 refactoring backlog)** â†’ **CONCERNS** status
- **Minor gaps (AC6, AC7 validation)** â†’ **CONCERNS** status
- **Full coverage (AC1-5, AC9)** â†’ **PASS** contribution

The infrastructure is solid and ready for production use. The primary concern is completing the refactoring work to enable full quality enforcement.
