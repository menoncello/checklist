# NFR Assessment: 1.15

Date: 2025-09-12
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - Enhanced security test coverage, no security gaps identified
- Performance: CONCERNS - Test execution time approaching limits, 31 tests skipped for performance
- Reliability: CONCERNS - StrykerJS tool issues encountered, conditional test skipping may mask issues
- Maintainability: CONCERNS - Mutation score target >90% not achieved, baseline not established

## Critical Issues

1. **Test Performance Approaching Limits** (Performance)
   - Risk: Test suite taking 34.36s for 1142 tests, averaging ~30ms per test
   - Risk: 31 tests being skipped for performance reasons during mutation testing
   - Fix: Optimize slow tests or increase timeout thresholds, investigate skipped tests

2. **Mutation Testing Tool Issues** (Reliability)
   - Risk: EAGAIN errors and timeout issues with StrykerJS reported in story
   - Risk: Environment variable STRYKER_MUTATOR_RUNNER handling issues
   - Fix: Resolve StrykerJS configuration issues, establish reliable mutation testing baseline

3. **Mutation Score Target Not Achieved** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: Story target of >90% mutation score not yet met
   - Risk: No baseline mutation score established to measure progress
   - Fix: Complete mutation testing setup, establish baseline, implement remaining test improvements

## Quick Wins

- Increase bunfig.toml test timeout from 5000ms to 10000ms: ~5 minutes
- Fix STRYKER_MUTATOR_RUNNER environment handling: ~2 hours  
- Establish mutation testing baseline: ~1 hour
- Optimize or fix skipped performance tests: ~4 hours

## Quality Score Calculation

Quality Score: 70 (100 - 10 for each CONCERNS attribute)
- Security: PASS (0 points deducted)
- Performance: CONCERNS (-10 points)
- Reliability: CONCERNS (-10 points) 
- Maintainability: CONCERNS (-10 points)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Increase test timeout limits to prevent performance-related test skipping
2. **Short-term**: Resolve StrykerJS tooling issues and establish mutation score baseline
3. **Medium-term**: Complete story implementation to achieve >90% mutation score target
4. **Long-term**: Implement continuous mutation testing monitoring in CI pipeline
