### 9. SEC-001: Dashboard Token Exposure
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Tokens in CI configuration
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Unauthorized access to mutation metrics
**Mitigation**:

### 11. TECH-004: False Positive Mutants
**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Some equivalent mutants inevitable
**Impact**: Low (1) - Minor annoyance, can be suppressed
**Mitigation**:
- Document known equivalent mutants
- Use Stryker disable comments sparingly
- Regular review of suppressed mutants
**Testing Focus**: Mutant validation

### 12. DATA-002: Report Storage Growth
**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Reports accumulate over time
**Impact**: Low (1) - Disk space usage
**Mitigation**:
- Implement report retention policy
- Archive old reports
- Use dashboard for historical data
**Testing Focus**: Storage monitoring
