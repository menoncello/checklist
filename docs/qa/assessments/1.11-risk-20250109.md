- Clean dependency tree verified (SEC-002)
- Production audit completed (BUS-001)
- API compatibility confirmed (TECH-001)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Performance monitoring in place (PERF-001)
- Rollback plan tested (OPS-001)
- Documentation updates scheduled (OPS-002)

### Accepted Risks
- Minor IDE inconveniences (TECH-004) - Team notified

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Security Alerts**: Any suspicious network activity or API calls
- **Error Rates**: CLI command failures or exceptions
- **Performance Metrics**: CLI operation response times
- **Dependency Alerts**: New vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Log Anomalies**: Unexpected log patterns or errors

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- New security vulnerabilities discovered in npm ecosystem
- Ansis package updates released
- CLI functionality expanded
- Build system changes
- Additional compromised packages identified

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. Remove all compromised packages immediately
2. Run comprehensive security audit
3. Test all CLI commands thoroughly
4. Verify no production compromise

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Implement automated dependency scanning
2. Add supply chain security to CI/CD
3. Document incident and response
4. Review security practices

### Long-term (This Month)
1. Establish dependency update policy
2. Implement SBOM generation
3. Regular security audits
4. Dependency pinning strategy

## Conclusion

This is a CRITICAL security incident requiring immediate action. The presence of confirmed malware in the dependency tree poses extreme risk to the system and potentially to production environments. The migration from chalk to ansis must be completed urgently but thoroughly, with careful attention to security verification and functional testing.

The risk score of 16/100 reflects the severity of having active malware in the codebase. This blocks all other development work until resolved.
