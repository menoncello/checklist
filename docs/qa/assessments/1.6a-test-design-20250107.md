## Test Data Requirements

### Valid State Files

- Complex nested state
- Large state (performance testing)
- State with all data types

### Invalid State Files
- Missing required fields
- Incorrect data types
- Corrupted YAML syntax
- Partial writes
- Binary corruption

### Lock Scenarios
- Fresh lock acquisition
- Stale lock from dead process
- Lock with active heartbeat
- Expired lock timeout

### WAL Scenarios
- Complete WAL with multiple operations

- Corrupted JSON in WAL
- Empty WAL file
- Very large WAL (performance)

## Test Environment Requirements

## Coverage Gaps Analysis

### Well Covered
- Core transaction flow
- Lock acquisition and release
- WAL operations
- Crash recovery
- State validation

### Gaps Requiring Additional Testing
- Windows-specific file locking edge cases
- Network file system behavior
- Disk space exhaustion scenarios
- Security permission edge cases

## Test Maintenance Considerations

### High Maintenance Tests
- E2E concurrent access tests (flaky potential)
- Cross-platform tests (environment specific)
- Performance tests (hardware dependent)

### Low Maintenance Tests
- Unit tests with mocked dependencies
- Schema validation tests
- Basic integration tests

## Quality Metrics

### Coverage Targets
- Line coverage: 90% minimum
- Branch coverage: 85% minimum
- Critical path coverage: 100%

### Performance Targets
- Unit tests: < 1ms each
- Integration tests: < 100ms each
- E2E tests: < 1s each

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize P0 tests** for immediate implementation
2. **Use property-based testing** for lock and WAL edge cases
3. **Implement chaos engineering** for crash scenarios
4. **Add continuous benchmarking** for performance regression
5. **Create test utilities** for common setup/teardown
6. **Document flaky test mitigation** strategies
