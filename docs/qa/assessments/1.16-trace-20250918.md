## Critical Gaps Identified

### 1. Incomplete Refactoring Coverage (AC8)

**Gap:** 40+ files across TUI, CLI, and Shared packages still exceed quality thresholds
**Risk:** High - Rules currently configured but may cause mass CI failures when fully enabled
**Action Needed:** Systematic refactoring of remaining packages

**Suggested Test Scenarios:**

- **Given:** TUI package files exceeding 300 lines
- **When:** Quality rules are fully enabled
- **Then:** Build succeeds without violations

- **Given:** CLI package complex functions > 30 lines
- **When:** Refactoring is applied
- **Then:** Functions meet complexity and length requirements

### 2. Performance Impact Assessment (Missing)

**Gap:** No testing of quality rule performance impact on CI/development workflow
**Risk:** Medium - Could slow development if rules are computationally expensive
**Action Needed:** Performance benchmarking of quality rule execution

**Suggested Test Scenarios:**

- **Given:** Large codebase with quality rules enabled
- **When:** ESLint runs in CI environment
- **Then:** Execution time remains under 30 seconds

- **Given:** Developer running pre-commit hooks
- **When:** Quality validation occurs
- **Then:** Hook execution completes under 5 seconds

## Test Design Recommendations

### Additional Test Scenarios Needed

1. **Edge Case Testing**
   ```yaml
   scenario: "Empty file handling"
   given: "File with only comments and blank lines"
   when: "max-lines rule is applied"
   then: "File passes quality checks (should not count toward line limit)"
   ```

2. **Configuration Validation**
   ```yaml
   scenario: "ESLint config inheritance"
   given: "Package-specific ESLint configs"
   when: "Quality rules are inherited"
   then: "Rules apply consistently across all packages"
   ```

3. **Report Content Accuracy**
   ```yaml
   scenario: "Multi-violation file reporting"
   given: "File violating multiple quality rules simultaneously"
   when: "HTML report is generated"
   then: "All violations are clearly documented with line numbers"
   ```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Incomplete refactoring backlog:** Could cause CI failures when rules are fully enabled
- **Mass violation potential:** 40+ files need refactoring before full rule activation

### Medium Risk
- **Performance impact:** Quality rules may slow CI/development workflow
- **Developer experience:** Complex violations may be difficult to resolve

### Low Risk
- **Configuration stability:** ESLint integration is well-tested
- **Report generation:** HTML output is validated and reliable

## Traceability Conclusions

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive test coverage for infrastructure (7/9 ACs fully covered)
- Strong CI/CD integration with proper failure handling
- Well-documented quality thresholds and enforcement mechanisms
- Effective pre-commit hook integration

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Complete remaining package refactoring work
- Add performance impact testing
- Implement progressive rule enablement strategy
- Document exemption process for edge cases

**Overall Assessment:** Requirements are well-traced with strong test coverage for the enforcement infrastructure. The primary concern is the technical debt requiring refactoring before full rule activation.
