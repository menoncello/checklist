## Purpose

This checklist ensures the Dev Agent has verified all dependencies, understands requirements, and is ready to implement Story 3.3 with minimal blockers.

---

## Phase 1: Dependency Verification

### Story 3.1 Artifacts (Template Loading)

- [ ] **TemplateSandbox class exists**
  - Location: `packages/core/src/templates/TemplateSandbox.ts` (or similar)
  - Verify constructor signature: `constructor(config: { maxExecutionTime: number, maxMemory: number })`
  - Verify method: `evaluate(expression: string, context: Record<string, any>): Promise<any>`
  - If missing: Note as blocker, may need to implement basic sandbox

- [ ] **TemplateEngine class exists**
  - Location: `packages/core/src/templates/TemplateEngine.ts` (or similar)
  - Verify constructor and public API
  - Verify it can be extended/integrated with variable system
  - If missing: Note as blocker, Task 7 integration will be deferred

- [ ] **LRU caching pattern available**
  - Check if caching utilities exist from Story 3.1
  - If missing: Implement simple Map-based cache for computed variables

### Story 3.2 Artifacts (Template Security)

- [ ] **TemplateAuditLogger pattern documented**
  - Review implementation from Story 3.2
  - Verify logging interface and usage pattern
  - If missing: Use standard Pino logger with structured logging

- [ ] **Security validation infrastructure**
  - Check if security utilities exist (validation, sanitization)
  - If missing: Implement security checks as part of variable validation

### Earlier Story Artifacts

- [ ] **WorkflowState interface exists**
  - Location: `packages/core/src/workflow/types.ts` (or similar)
  - Verify current structure
  - Confirm it can be extended with `variables` field
  - If missing: Create minimal WorkflowState interface for testing

  - Run: `git status` - should be on branch `3.3-conditional-logic` or new feature branch
  - No uncommitted changes that could interfere

- [ ] **Quality checks passing**
  - Run: `bun run lint` - should pass
  - Run: `bun run typecheck` - should pass
  - Run: `bun test` - all existing tests should pass

- [ ] **Create feature branch (if needed)**
  - If not on `3.3-conditional-logic`, create: `git checkout -b feature/3.3-variable-system`

### Directory Structure

- [ ] **Create variables directory**
  - Create: `packages/core/src/variables/`
  - Verify parent exists: `packages/core/src/`

- [ ] **Create test directory**
  - Create: `packages/core/tests/variables/`
  - Create: `packages/core/tests/variables/integration/`
  - Verify parent exists: `packages/core/tests/`

---

## Phase 3: Implementation Sequence Understanding

### Task Execution Order

- [ ] **Review Task 1: Variable Schema & Types**
  - Understand all type definitions needed (lines 176-206 in story)
  - Note: This is the foundation - must be solid
  - Files to create: `types.ts`, `VariableValidator.ts`, `errors.ts`, `index.ts`

- [ ] **Review Task 2: Variable Storage**
  - Understand persistence requirements (YAML, atomic writes)
  - Note: Depends on Task 1 types
  - Files to create: `VariableStore.ts`

- [ ] **Review Task 3: Scoping System**
  - Understand global vs step-level scope resolution
  - Note: Depends on Task 2 storage
  - Files to create: `VariableScopeManager.ts`

- [ ] **Review Task 4: Environment Variables**
  - Understand security allowlist requirements
  - Note: Independent of other tasks, can be parallel with Task 5
  - Files to create: `EnvironmentVariableResolver.ts`

- [ ] **Review Task 5: Variable Prompting**
  - Understand console-based prompting (not TUI yet)
  - Note: Depends on Task 1, Task 4
  - Files to create: `VariablePrompter.ts`

- [ ] **Review Task 6: Computed Variables**
  - Understand expression evaluation and dependency management
  - Note: Depends on Task 1, Task 2, Task 3 - verify TemplateSandbox API first
  - Files to create: `ComputedVariableEngine.ts`

- [ ] **Review Task 7: Integration**
  - Understand integration points with TemplateEngine
  - Note: Depends on all previous tasks
  - Files to modify: `TemplateEngine.ts`, `types.ts` (WorkflowState)

- [ ] **Review Task 8: Testing**
  - Understand all test requirements (unit, integration, performance)
  - Note: Write tests alongside implementation
  - Files to create: Multiple test files in `packages/core/tests/variables/`

---

## Phase 4: Requirements Validation

  - Overall: 80% minimum
  - Core package: 90% minimum (this story is in core)
  - New code: 100% expected

- [ ] **Mutation testing**
  - StrykerJS threshold: 85%+
  - Plan for mutation test runs

  - Function size: Maximum 30 lines
  - Cyclomatic complexity: Maximum 10
  - Constructor parameters: Maximum 4 (use parameter objects)
  - No `any` types without justification
  - Use `??` for nullish coalescing, not `||`

---

## Phase 6: Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation

4. **Profile performance early** - Don't wait until the end
5. **Document as you go** - JSDoc and inline comments
6. **Commit logical units** - Small, focused commits

---

## Success Criteria

## Questions or Blockers?

If any checklist item cannot be completed or reveals a blocker:

1. Document the blocker clearly
2. Assess if it's critical or can be worked around
3. Update story with blocker notes
4. Seek clarification if requirements are unclear

**Remember**: This checklist is your friend. Use it to ensure quality and completeness!
