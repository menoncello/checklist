### Critical Gaps

**No Critical Gaps Identified**

All 8 acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage with both unit and performance tests where applicable.

### Test Design Recommendations

**Current Test Coverage is Excellent:**

1. **Unit Tests**: All components have comprehensive unit tests covering core functionality
2. **Performance Tests**: Critical NFRs (startup <100ms, layout reflow <50ms) have dedicated performance tests
3. **Integration Tests**: Components are tested in isolation with proper mocking
4. **Error Scenarios**: Error handling and panic recovery are thoroughly tested

**Minor Enhancement Opportunities:**

1. **End-to-End Tests**: Consider adding integration tests that validate the complete application lifecycle
2. **Visual Regression Tests**: Add tests for terminal output validation during critical operations
3. **Load Tests**: Consider tests for sustained operation under load

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None - All requirements have full test coverage
- **Medium Risk**: None - All critical paths have multiple test levels
- **Low Risk**: None - All requirements have comprehensive validation

### Test Architecture Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every acceptance criterion has corresponding tests
2. **Performance Validation**: NFRs are explicitly tested with measurable thresholds
3. **Error Resilience**: Error scenarios and panic recovery are well-tested
4. **Component Isolation**: Tests use proper mocking to test components in isolation
5. **Realistic Scenarios**: Tests reflect real-world usage patterns and edge cases

### Test Quality Metrics

- **Total Test Files**: 6 primary test files
- **Total Test Cases**: 50+ individual test scenarios
- **Performance Benchmarks**: 15 performance validation tests
