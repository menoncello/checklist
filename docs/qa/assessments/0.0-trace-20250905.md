### Critical Gaps

1. **Pre-commit Hooks (AC9)**
   - Gap: No hook installation or execution tests
   - Risk: High - Code quality checks may be bypassed
   - Action: Implement husky setup with test verification

2. **Environment Variables (AC10)**
   - Gap: No test for .env file loading
   - Risk: Medium - Configuration errors at runtime
   - Action: Add test to verify env var availability

3. **External Service Access (AC11-13)**
   - Gap: No verification of GitHub, npm, or package manager access
   - Risk: Medium - Publishing/distribution blockers discovered late
   - Action: Add connectivity tests for external services

4. **CI/CD Configuration (AC14)**
   - Gap: No local validation of GitHub Actions setup
   - Risk: Low - Failures visible in PR checks
   - Action: Consider act or similar for local CI testing

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Setup Validation Suite**
   - Create `setup.test.ts` to verify all tools installed
   - Check versions, paths, and configurations
   - Run as part of initial setup process

2. **Environment Tests**
   - Test for .env file presence and loading
   - Verify required variables are set
   - Check for sensitive data exposure

3. **Workspace Validation**
   - Automated test for all workspace packages
   - Verify inter-package dependencies resolve
   - Check for circular dependencies

4. **External Service Checks**
   - Implement connectivity tests (can be skipped in CI)
   - Verify authentication where possible
   - Document manual verification steps

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**:
  - Pre-commit hooks not tested (AC9)
  - Could allow non-conforming code into repository

- **Medium Risk**:
  - Environment configuration (AC10)
  - External service access (AC11-13)
  - Manual-only verification for critical tools (AC1-3, 5-6)

- **Low Risk**:
  - All build tools fully covered (AC15-18)
  - Terminal capabilities verified (AC4)
  - Core functionality has smoke tests

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Implement pre-commit hook testing
   - Add environment variable validation tests
   - Create automated setup verification script

2. **Future Improvements**:
   - Add integration tests for full development workflow
   - Implement connectivity tests for external services
   - Create setup troubleshooting guide based on common issues

3. **Documentation Needs**:
   - Platform-specific setup variations
   - Troubleshooting guide for common issues
   - Verification checklist for manual steps
