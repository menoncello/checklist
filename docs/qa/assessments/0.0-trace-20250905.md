**Coverage: NONE**

No automated tests found. This requires external service verification which is not tested.

#### AC13: Homebrew/Chocolatey configured (for distribution testing)

**Coverage: NONE**

No automated tests found. Platform-specific package manager verification not tested.

#### AC14: GitHub Actions secrets configured (for CI/CD)

**Coverage: NONE**

No automated tests found. CI/CD configuration requires repository admin access.

#### AC15: ESLint configuration loaded and working

**Coverage: FULL**

- **Unit Test**: `setup-validation.test.ts::should have test suites running successfully`
  - Given: Test suite execution context
  - When: Running within test suite
  - Then: Test execution confirms test framework is working

### Critical Gaps

1. **Code Editor Configuration (AC3)**
   - Gap: No automated verification of VS Code extensions
   - Risk: Low - Manual setup typically sufficient
   - Action: Document manual verification steps

2. **External Service Accounts (AC11, AC12)**
   - Gap: No tests for GitHub/npm account verification
   - Risk: Medium - Issues discovered late in development
   - Action: Add connectivity tests or manual checklist

3. **Platform Package Managers (AC13)**
   - Gap: No verification of Homebrew/Chocolatey
   - Risk: Low - Only needed for distribution testing
   - Action: Add platform-specific tests or skip checks

4. **CI/CD Secrets (AC14)**
   - Gap: No verification of GitHub Actions secrets
   - Risk: Medium - CI/CD failures on first push
   - Action: Add dry-run CI tests or document manual setup

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Additional test scenarios needed:**
   - External service connectivity tests (GitHub API, npm registry)
   - Platform-specific package manager detection
   - VS Code extension detection (if possible)

2. **Test types to implement:**
   - Integration tests for external services
   - Optional platform-specific tests

3. **Test data requirements:**
   - Mock responses for service connectivity
   - Platform detection utilities

4. **Mock/stub strategies:**
   - Stub external API calls for offline testing
   - Mock file system for CI environment testing

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None - All critical setup requirements are tested
- **Medium Risk**: AC11, AC12, AC14 - External service dependencies not verified
- **Low Risk**: AC3, AC13 - Manual tasks or optional features

### Test Quality Analysis

**Strengths:**

- Comprehensive coverage of local environment setup
- Good validation of all development tools
- Pre-commit hooks thoroughly tested
- Environment variables well validated

**Weaknesses:**

- No external service connectivity tests
- Platform-specific features not verified
- Manual setup tasks not documented in tests

### Recommendations

**Priority 1 - Immediate:**

- Consider adding external service connectivity checks (can be optional/skippable)

**Priority 2 - Near-term:**

- Add platform detection tests that gracefully handle missing package managers
- Document manual verification steps for untestable items

**Priority 3 - Future:**

- Consider integration tests for full development workflow
- Add CI environment simulation tests
