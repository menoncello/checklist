# Risk Profile: Story 0.0 - Development Environment Setup

Date: 2025-01-05
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 73/100 (Moderate Risk)

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Cross-Platform Compatibility Issues

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Bun is relatively new and may have platform-specific bugs
**Impact**: Medium - Can be worked around but causes friction
**Mitigation**:
- Implement Node.js with tsx as fallback option
- Test setup scripts on Windows (WSL2), macOS, and Linux
- Document platform-specific requirements clearly
- Provide Docker development container as alternative

**Testing Focus**: 
- Cross-platform installation verification
- Terminal compatibility testing
- Build process validation on each OS

### 2. OPS-001: Incomplete Environment Setup Blocks Development

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Complex setup with multiple tools
**Impact**: High - Completely blocks all development work
**Mitigation**:
- Create automated setup validation script
- Provide comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- Implement setup wizard for guided installation
- Add smoke tests to verify environment

**Testing Focus**:
- Fresh environment setup testing
- Validation command accuracy
- Error message clarity

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|--------|----------|
| TECH-001 | Cross-Platform Compatibility | High (3) | Medium (2) | 6 | High |
| OPS-001 | Setup Blocks Development | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| TECH-002 | Terminal Compatibility | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| SEC-001 | Exposed Secrets in Config | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| DATA-001 | Dependency Conflicts | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- **Cross-platform validation**: Test complete setup on Windows/WSL2, macOS (Intel/ARM), Linux
- **Setup verification**: Run all validation commands from acceptance criteria
- **Fallback testing**: Verify Node.js fallback works when Bun unavailable

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- **Terminal rendering**: Test TUI components on iTerm2, Windows Terminal, Alacritty, basic terminal
- **Security checks**: Verify .gitignore prevents committing secrets
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Test that hooks catch common issues

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
- **Dependency resolution**: Test clean install, update scenarios
- **Documentation accuracy**: Verify all commands in docs work

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Development Starts
- Bun installation with Node.js fallback mechanism
- All verification commands must pass
- Basic terminal compatibility verified

### Can Proceed with Mitigation
- Terminal rendering issues (with ASCII fallback)
- Minor platform-specific quirks (with documentation)

### Accepted Risks
- Some edge-case terminal emulators may have issues
- Future Bun updates may introduce breaking changes

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-setup monitoring:
- Track setup time per platform
- Document common setup issues
- Monitor Bun version compatibility
- Track terminal rendering problems

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Bun major version updates
- New development tools added
- Platform support changes
- Team expands to new OS/environments
- Terminal rendering library changes

## Recommendations

### Development Focus
1. **Setup Automation**: Prioritize setup script that handles common issues
2. **Validation Suite**: Comprehensive checks for all tools and configs
3. **Documentation**: Platform-specific guides with troubleshooting

### Testing Priority
1. Multi-platform setup validation
2. Terminal compatibility matrix
3. Dependency resolution testing
4. Security configuration validation

### Deployment Strategy
- Not applicable (development environment only)
- Consider containerized dev environment as backup option
