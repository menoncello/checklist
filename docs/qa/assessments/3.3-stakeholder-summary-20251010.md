**Key Highlights**:
- ✅ All 7 acceptance criteria validated and covered
- ✅ Comprehensive implementation plan with 8 tasks
- ✅ Security measures aligned with Story 3.2 infrastructure
- ✅ Performance targets clearly defined (<1ms lookup, <10ms persistence)
- ✅ 90%+ test coverage requirement (core package standard)
- ✅ Complete documentation and starter code provided

---

## Story Overview

### Business Value

Enables workflows to adapt dynamically to project needs through:
- **Variable types and defaults** - Flexible configuration options
- **Required variable prompting** - Guided user experience during workflow initialization
- **Persistent state** - Variables saved across sessions
- **Multi-level scoping** - Global and step-level variable management
- **Environment integration** - Secure access to system environment variables
- **Computed expressions** - Dynamic values based on other variables
- **Type validation** - Data integrity and error prevention

### Acceptance Criteria (All 7 Validated)

| # | Criterion | Coverage |
|---|-----------|----------|
| AC1 | Variables with types and defaults | ✅ Task 1, Task 8 |
| AC2 | Required variables prompted during init | ✅ Task 5 |
| AC3 | Variables persist in state.yaml | ✅ Task 2 |
| AC4 | Global and step-level scope | ✅ Task 3 |
| AC5 | Environment variable access | ✅ Task 4 |
| AC6 | Computed variables with expressions | ✅ Task 6 |
| AC7 | Type validation (string, number, boolean, array) | ✅ Task 1, Task 8 |

**Note**: Original AC5 (Variable editor in TUI) has been intentionally deferred to a future story to maintain focus on core variable management implementation.

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation Strategy | Status |
|------|----------|---------------------|--------|
| TemplateSandbox API mismatch | Medium | Verify API first (Task 6); Implement BasicSandbox if needed | ✅ Mitigated |
| TemplateEngine integration complexity | Medium | Review Story 3.1/3.2 implementation; Create wrapper if needed | ✅ Mitigated |
| Performance targets not met | Low | Profile early and often; Implement caching | ✅ Mitigated |
| Circular dependency detection complexity | Low | Use established graph algorithms; Simple visited set with max depth | ✅ Mitigated |

**Overall Risk Level**: ✅ **LOW** - All risks identified and mitigation plans in place

---

## Dependencies & Blockers

### Story Dependencies

**From Story 3.1 (Template Loading)**:
- `TemplateSandbox` class - Used for safe expression evaluation
- `TemplateEngine` class - Will be extended for variable integration
- LRU caching pattern - Leveraged for computed variables

**From Story 3.2 (Template Security)**:
- `TemplateSandbox` security infrastructure
- `TemplateAuditLogger` pattern - Used for variable audit trail
- Security validation infrastructure

**From Earlier Stories**:
- `WorkflowState` interface - Will be extended with variables field

### Current Blockers

**None** - Story is ready for implementation

If dependencies from Story 3.1/3.2 are unavailable, fallback strategies are documented:
- BasicSandbox implementation provided
- Integration can be deferred
- Core functionality can proceed independently

## Deliverables Created

### Documentation Artifacts

| Artifact | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Story v1.2 | Requirements | Complete story with improvements and approval |
| Pre-Implementation Checklist | Quality Gate | 50+ verification items across 8 phases |
| Quick Start Guide | Development Aid | 5-minute fast-start with starter code |
| Stakeholder Summary | Executive Report | High-level overview and status (this document) |

### Starter Code Provided

The Quick Start Guide includes complete, ready-to-use code for:
- ✅ `packages/core/src/variables/types.ts` - All type definitions
- ✅ `packages/core/src/variables/errors.ts` - 7 error classes
- ✅ `packages/core/src/variables/index.ts` - Export structure
- ✅ `packages/core/tests/variables/types.test.ts` - First test

## Implementation Plan

### Task Breakdown (8 Tasks)

| Task | Description | Files | Dependencies |
|------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Variable schema and type system | types.ts, VariableValidator.ts, errors.ts | None |
| 2 | Variable storage in state.yaml | VariableStore.ts | Task 1 |
| 3 | Variable scoping system | VariableScopeManager.ts | Task 2 |
| 4 | Environment variable access | EnvironmentVariableResolver.ts | None (parallel with Task 5) |
| 5 | Required variable prompting | VariablePrompter.ts | Task 1, Task 4 |
| 6 | Computed variables with expressions | ComputedVariableEngine.ts | Task 1-3, TemplateSandbox |
| 7 | Integration with template engine | TemplateEngine.ts (modify) | Task 1-6 |
| 8 | Comprehensive testing | Multiple test files | Task 1-7 |

**Estimated Complexity**: Medium
**Estimated Timeline**: 3-5 development sessions (depends on Story 3.1/3.2 artifacts availability)

### Critical Path

```
Task 1 (Foundation) → Task 2 (Storage) → Task 3 (Scoping) → Task 6 (Computed) → Task 7 (Integration)
                                                              ↓
Task 4 (Env Vars) → Task 5 (Prompting) ----------------------↑
                                                              ↓
                                                        Task 8 (Testing)
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Dev Agent Review** (Recommended)

   - Work through Pre-Implementation Checklist
   - Use Quick Start Guide to begin coding

2. **Dependency Verification**
   - Verify Story 3.1/3.2 artifacts (TemplateSandbox, TemplateEngine)
   - Document any blockers found
   - Apply fallback strategies if needed

3. **Implementation Start**
   - Begin with Task 1 (foundation types and schema)
   - Follow TDD approach (write tests alongside code)
   - Run quality checks frequently
   - Commit logical units with clear messages

### Monitoring & Communication

- **Progress Updates**: Track task completion in story document
- **Blocker Communication**: Document and escalate any critical blockers immediately
- **Quality Metrics**: Run and report coverage/mutation test results
- **Performance Validation**: Benchmark and report against targets

---

## Stakeholder Approval

### Product Owner Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **APPROVED**

**Confidence Level**: **HIGH** (9/10)

**Rationale**:
- Story is comprehensive, well-structured, and actionable
- All acceptance criteria covered with clear task mapping
- Security considerations properly addressed
- Performance targets clearly defined
- Dependencies identified with mitigation plans
- Quality gates established
- Development team provided with extensive documentation and starter code

**Concerns**: None critical. Minor dependency verification needed for Story 3.1/3.2 artifacts.
