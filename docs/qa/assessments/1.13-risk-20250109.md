- Medium Risks: 4
- Low Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 48/100 (Significant risk - requires careful mitigation)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Circular Dependency Detection Failure

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Current DIContainer implementation lacks circular dependency detection
**Impact**: High - Application crashes, stack overflow, runtime failures
**Mitigation**:
- Implement dependency graph tracking before resolution
- Add cycle detection algorithm (DFS with visited/visiting states)
- Fail fast with clear error messages identifying the circular path
- Create unit tests specifically for circular dependency scenarios

**Testing Focus**: 
- Test A→B→C→A circular chains
- Test self-referential dependencies
- Test transitive circular dependencies

### 2. TECH-002: Service Lifecycle Race Conditions

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Multiple services with async initialization creating/using shared resources
**Impact**: High - Data corruption, undefined behavior, service initialization failures
**Mitigation**:
- Implement proper initialization ordering based on dependency graph
- Add semaphore/mutex patterns for resource access during init
- Ensure all services complete initialization before allowing resolution
- Add timeout mechanisms for initialization deadlock detection

**Testing Focus**:
- Concurrent service initialization tests
- Resource contention scenarios
- Initialization failure recovery tests

## High Risk Areas

### 3. PERF-001: DI Container Resolution Performance Degradation

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Current implementation recreates non-singleton instances on every resolve
**Impact**: High - Significant performance impact on hot paths, violates <1ms requirement
**Mitigation**:
- Implement factory result caching for frequently resolved services
- Use WeakMap for temporary instance caching
- Profile resolution paths with Tinybench
- Consider lazy initialization patterns

### 4. TECH-003: Breaking Changes to Existing Global Dependencies

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - 15+ files directly using createLogger() instead of injection
**Impact**: Medium - Extensive refactoring required, potential for regression bugs
**Mitigation**:
- Create backward compatibility layer during migration
- Implement adapter pattern for gradual migration
- Use feature flags to toggle between old/new patterns
- Comprehensive regression test suite

### 5. SEC-001: Service Impersonation via Container Manipulation

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - No access control on service registration/override
**Impact**: High - Malicious code could replace critical services
**Mitigation**:
- Implement container sealing after initial configuration
- Add service registration validation
- Use readonly interfaces for resolved services
- Audit trail for service registration/resolution

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

**Circular Dependency Tests**:
```typescript
// Test direct circular dependency A→B→A
// Test transitive circular dependency A→B→C→A
// Test self-reference A→A
// Test late-binding circular dependencies
```

**Service Lifecycle Tests**:
```typescript
// Test concurrent initialization of 100+ services
// Test initialization failure recovery
// Test shutdown ordering
// Test resource cleanup on failure
```

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

**Performance Tests**:
```typescript
// Benchmark 10,000 service resolutions
// Test memory usage with 1000 singleton services
// Profile hot path resolution times
// Test cache effectiveness
```

**Migration Tests**:
```typescript
// Test backward compatibility layer
// Test gradual migration scenarios
// Test rollback procedures
// Integration tests for migrated services
```

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Standard unit tests for all interfaces
- Mock service behavior validation
- Error message security audit
- Documentation completeness checks

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- TECH-001: Circular dependency detection (Critical)
- TECH-002: Service lifecycle race conditions (Critical)
- SEC-001: Service registration security (High)
- PERF-001: Resolution performance must meet <1ms requirement

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- TECH-003: Global dependency migration (with compatibility layer)
- TECH-004: Memory leak prevention (with monitoring)
- PERF-002: Startup time (if under 50ms threshold)

### Accepted Risks

- BUS-001: Developer adoption (with documentation/training)
- TECH-006: Interface drift (with regular audits)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Service resolution times (p50, p95, p99)
  - Memory usage trends
  - Startup time measurements
  - Container size growth

- **Security Alerts**:
  - Unexpected service registration attempts
  - Service resolution failures
  - Access pattern anomalies

- **Operational Metrics**:
  - Service initialization failures
  - Circular dependency detection triggers
  - Mock vs real service usage in production

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Adding new service interfaces
- Modifying container resolution logic
- Changing service lifecycle management
- Performance degradation detected
- Security audit findings
- Major refactoring of existing services

## Specific Implementation Risks

### Existing Partial Implementation Issues

1. **DIContainer.ts** already exists but lacks:
   - Circular dependency detection
   - Proper error handling
   - Performance optimization
   - Security controls

2. **BaseService.ts** exists but missing:
   - Dependency injection mechanism
   - Proper lifecycle coordination
   - Resource cleanup guarantees

3. **Direct createLogger() usage** in 15+ files:
   - StateManager, WorkflowEngine, etc. directly instantiate logger
   - Will require significant refactoring
   - Risk of regression bugs

### Migration Complexity

- **High-Risk Files** requiring careful migration:
  - `/packages/core/src/state/StateManager.ts`
  - `/packages/core/src/workflow/WorkflowEngine.ts`
  - `/packages/core/src/state/TransactionCoordinator.ts`
  - All state-related services with complex interdependencies

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Implement circular dependency detection** before any other DI work
2. **Create comprehensive test suite** for edge cases
3. **Design migration strategy** with rollback capability
4. **Performance benchmark** current vs DI implementation

### Development Approach

1. **Phase 1**: Enhance existing DIContainer with safety features
2. **Phase 2**: Create interfaces and mock implementations
3. **Phase 3**: Gradual migration with compatibility layer
4. **Phase 4**: Remove legacy patterns after validation

### Testing Requirements

- Minimum 90% code coverage for DI system
- Mutation testing score >85% for container logic
- Performance regression tests with <1ms threshold
- Security penetration testing for container manipulation
