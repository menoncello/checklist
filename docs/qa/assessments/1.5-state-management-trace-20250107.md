### Coverage Analysis

All 9 acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage across multiple test levels:

- **Unit Tests**: 24 test files covering individual components
- **Integration Tests**: 14 tests validating component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: 4 tests validating complete workflows
- **Acceptance Tests**: Direct AC validation in `acceptance-criteria.test.ts`

### Critical Gaps

**No gaps identified** - All acceptance criteria have full test coverage.

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on the traceability analysis:

1. **Strengths**:
   - Complete AC coverage with dedicated acceptance test file
   - Multiple test levels (unit, integration, E2E)
   - Performance validation implemented
   - Security features well-tested

2. **Maintenance Recommendations**:
   - Keep acceptance-criteria.test.ts as source of truth
   - Maintain performance benchmarks under 50ms
   - Continue transaction and concurrency testing

3. **Future Considerations**:
   - Add chaos engineering tests for resilience
   - Implement property-based testing for state transitions
   - Add multi-node distributed locking tests

### Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: All requirements have comprehensive test coverage
- **Test Confidence**: Very High - Multiple test levels validate each AC
- **Coverage Quality**: Excellent - Direct AC tests plus supporting unit/integration tests
