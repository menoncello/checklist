### Migration Script Coverage

### CLI Integration Coverage

#### CLI Commands

**Coverage: NONE**

**Gap**: No test files found for CLI migration commands:
- `checklist migrate --check`
- `checklist migrate --dry-run`
- `checklist migrate --backup-only`
- `checklist migrate --restore`
- `checklist migrate --list-backups`

### Performance Requirements

#### Migration Performance (<500ms)

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

- Tests verify successful migration but no explicit performance benchmarks found
- **Gap**: Missing Tinybench performance tests for large state files

### Additional Coverage

  - Given: Migration with validate function
  - When: Migration applies
  - Then: Validation is executed and checked

#### Backup Rotation

#### Migration History Tracking

**Coverage: FULL**

- **Integration Test**: `migrationPaths.test.ts` shows migrations array updates
  - Given: Successful migration
  - When: State is saved
  - Then: Migration history is recorded

### Critical Gaps

1. **CLI Command Testing**
   - Gap: No test coverage for any CLI migration commands
   - Risk: High - User-facing commands untested
   - Action: Implement CLI command tests in `/packages/cli/tests/commands/migrate.test.ts`

2. **Rollback on Failure**
   - Gap: Rollback capability exists but not explicitly tested for failure scenarios
   - Risk: Medium - Recovery mechanism unverified
   - Action: Add explicit rollback failure tests

3. **Progress Indicators**
   - Gap: No tests for progress event emissions or console output
   - Risk: Low - UX feature but not critical
   - Action: Add tests for event emitter and progress tracking

4. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Gap: No explicit performance tests with Tinybench
   - Risk: Medium - Large migrations might exceed 500ms limit
   - Action: Add performance benchmarks for various file sizes

5. **Backup Rotation**
   - Gap: Backup rotation (keep last 10) not tested
   - Risk: Low - Could lead to disk space issues
   - Action: Add test for backup cleanup logic

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **CLI Integration Tests** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Test all migration CLI commands
   - Verify command output and state changes
   - Test error handling for invalid inputs

2. **Failure Recovery Tests** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Simulate migration failures at various stages
   - Verify rollback restores original state
   - Test backup integrity after rollback

3. **Performance Tests** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Benchmark with 1MB, 10MB, 100MB state files
   - Verify <500ms for typical files
   - Profile memory usage during migration

4. **Event/Progress Tests** (Priority: LOW)
   - Verify progress events are emitted
   - Test percentage calculation accuracy
   - Validate console output formatting

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: CLI commands have no test coverage - critical user interface untested
- **Medium Risk**: Rollback scenarios partially covered - recovery mechanism not fully validated
- **Low Risk**: Core migration logic well tested with 82.6% requirement coverage

### Overall Quality Assessment

The migration system has strong core functionality testing with comprehensive coverage of:
- Version detection heuristics
- Migration path finding (Dijkstra's algorithm)
- Sequential migration execution
- State preservation during migration
- Validation mechanisms

However, user-facing aspects (CLI, progress indicators) and failure recovery scenarios need additional test coverage to ensure production readiness.
