Date: 2025-09-27
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - Terminal initialization validation and signal handling implemented
- Performance: CONCERNS - Performance tests exist but actual benchmark validation needed
- Reliability: PASS - Error boundaries, graceful degradation, and recovery mechanisms in place
- Maintainability: PASS - Test coverage at 85% target with comprehensive test files

## Critical Issues

1. **Performance benchmark validation missing** (Performance)
   - Risk: Cannot verify <100ms startup and <50ms layout reflow requirements
   - Fix: Run performance benchmarks and validate against targets

2. **Performance monitoring in production** (Performance)
   - Risk: No runtime performance tracking for deployed application
   - Fix: Add performance monitoring hooks in production builds

## Quick Wins

- Validate performance benchmarks: ~30 minutes
- Add production performance monitoring: ~2 hours
- Add performance regression tests in CI: ~1 hour
