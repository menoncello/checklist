## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Concurrent Write Testing**: Spawn 100+ processes attempting simultaneous state updates
- **Corruption Recovery Testing**: Simulate various corruption scenarios (truncated files, invalid JSON, checksum mismatches)
- **Security Scanning**: Run secret detection tools on state files, test git hooks
- **Stress Testing**: Extended duration tests with continuous read/write operations
- **Failure Injection**: Kill processes mid-write, simulate power loss

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Test file locking on Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Performance Testing**: Measure lock acquisition times under load
- **Migration Testing**: Test schema upgrades from previous versions
- **Monitoring Validation**: Verify audit logs capture all operations

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Backup Testing**: Verify rotation and cleanup policies
- **Permission Testing**: Test with various file system permissions
- **Large File Testing**: Test with state files >1MB
- **API Compatibility**: Test with different Bun versions
