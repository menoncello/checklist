Story: Core Workflow Engine

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 7
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 4
- Medium Risks: 1
- Low Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 61/100 (Moderate Risk)

## High-Priority Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Event System Memory Leaks
**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: Medium - EventEmitter pattern commonly causes leaks without proper cleanup
**Impact**: High - Memory exhaustion could crash the application
**Mitigation**:
- Implement automatic listener cleanup on workflow completion
- Add listener count limits per event type
- Create dispose() method for proper cleanup
- Monitor memory usage in tests

**Testing Focus**: Memory leak detection tests, long-running workflow simulations

### 2. TECH-003: Conditional Logic Evaluation Failures  
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Complex expressions likely to have edge cases
**Impact**: Medium - Could skip critical steps or execute wrong branches
**Mitigation**:
- Use sandboxed evaluation (vm2 or similar)
- Whitelist allowed operations
- Extensive unit testing of condition evaluator
- Consider using a proper expression parser instead of eval

**Testing Focus**: Edge case testing for conditions, security testing

### 3. SEC-001: Code Injection via Condition Evaluation
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - safeEval implementation vulnerability
**Impact**: High - Potential for arbitrary code execution
**Mitigation**:
- Replace eval-based approach with AST parser
- Use template literal evaluation only
- Implement strict input validation
- Consider JSONLogic or similar safe evaluation library

**Testing Focus**: Security testing with malicious payloads, fuzzing

### 4. DATA-001: Workflow State Persistence Loss
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - No persistence mechanism specified
**Impact**: High - Loss of progress on crash/restart
**Mitigation**:
- Implement state serialization/deserialization
- Add auto-save on state changes
- Create recovery mechanism
- Document persistence strategy

**Testing Focus**: Crash recovery tests, state serialization tests

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Security & Stability Tests
1. **Memory Leak Detection**
   - Run 1000+ workflow cycles
   - Monitor heap usage growth
   - Test listener cleanup

2. **Condition Evaluation Security**
   - Test with malicious payloads
   - Attempt code injection
   - Verify sandboxing

3. **State Persistence**
   - Simulate crashes at each step
   - Verify state recovery
   - Test concurrent workflows

### Priority 2: Functional Integrity Tests
1. **State Machine Validation**
   - Test all valid transitions
   - Attempt invalid transitions
   - Verify state consistency

2. **Conditional Logic**
   - Test all condition types
   - Complex nested conditions
   - Edge cases and nulls

### Priority 3: Performance Tests
1. **Large Template Handling**
   - Load 10,000 step template
   - Measure memory usage
   - Check operation timing (<10ms)

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- SEC-001: Code injection vulnerability
- TECH-001: Memory leak prevention
- DATA-001: Basic persistence mechanism

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- TECH-002: With comprehensive state validation
- TECH-003: With extensive test coverage
- OPS-001: With proper logging/monitoring

### Accepted Risks
- PERF-001: Performance optimization can be iterative

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Memory usage trends (TECH-001)
- Error rates in condition evaluation (TECH-003)
- State corruption incidents (TECH-002)
- Performance metrics for large templates (PERF-001)

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Changing condition evaluation mechanism
- Adding new event types
- Modifying state machine logic
- Implementing persistence layer
- Performance requirements change

## Recommendations

### Development Focus
1. **Replace eval-based condition evaluation** with safe alternative
2. **Implement comprehensive dispose() method** for cleanup
3. **Add state persistence layer** with recovery capability
4. **Create extensive unit test suite** for state transitions

### Testing Priority
1. Security testing for condition evaluation
2. Memory leak detection tests
3. State recovery/persistence tests
4. Performance benchmarks with large templates

### Deployment Strategy
- Deploy with feature flag for gradual rollout
- Monitor memory usage closely in production
- Have rollback plan ready
- Consider canary deployment
