## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. DATA-001: State File Corruption and Loss
**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability**: High - File system operations are prone to corruption during concurrent access or system crashes  
**Impact**: High - Complete loss of workflow progress across all projects, requiring full restart  
**Mitigation**:
- Implement atomic write operations with temporary file + rename pattern
- Add automatic backup before each state modification
- Create recovery mechanism with versioned state history
- Implement file locking for concurrent access protection
**Testing Focus**: Simulate power failures during write operations, test concurrent modifications, verify backup/recovery procedures

### 2. SEC-001: Command Injection via Template Variables
**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability**: High - User-provided variables are substituted directly into commands  
**Impact**: High - Arbitrary command execution could compromise developer systems  
**Mitigation**:
- Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all variables
- Use parameterized command execution rather than string concatenation
- Create sandboxed execution environment for template commands
- Add explicit allow-list for command patterns
**Testing Focus**: Penetration testing with malicious payloads, fuzzing variable inputs, security scanning

### 3. TECH-001: Performance Degradation with Large Workflows
**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability**: High - Complex BMAD workflows can have 100+ steps with nested conditions  
**Impact**: High - Violates NFR1 (100ms response time), breaking developer flow  
**Mitigation**:
- Implement lazy loading for workflow steps
- Add indexing for quick navigation
- Cache parsed templates in memory

- Comprehensive help system
- Example templates for common workflows
- Video documentation
**Testing Focus**: Usability testing with new users, measure time-to-first-success

### 7. TECH-002: Bun Runtime Stability Issues
**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: Medium - Bun is relatively new runtime  
**Impact**: High - Core functionality broken  
**Mitigation**:
- Maintain Node.js fallback option
- Pin specific Bun version
- Extensive compatibility testing
**Testing Focus**: Regression testing across Bun versions, stress testing runtime

### 8. SEC-002: Sensitive Data Exposure in History
**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: Medium - Developers may include secrets in commands  
**Impact**: High - Credential leakage through Git  
**Mitigation**:
- Secret detection and masking
- Configurable history exclusions
- Warning prompts for sensitive patterns
**Testing Focus**: Secret scanning, audit log review
