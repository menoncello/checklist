## Medium Risks

### 5. TECH-002: Development workflow disruption

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Hot reload and watch modes may break during migration
**Impact**: Medium - Developer experience temporarily degraded

**Mitigation**:

### 6. BUS-001: Learning curve and adoption resistance

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Team needs to learn new Turborepo commands and concepts
**Impact**: Medium - Temporary productivity loss during learning period

**Mitigation**:
- Create comprehensive documentation and cheat sheets
- Provide hands-on training sessions
- Start with pilot migration to build team confidence
- Keep existing commands available during transition

## Low Risks

### 7. OPS-002: Monitoring and observability gaps

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Existing monitoring can be extended
**Impact**: Medium - Reduced visibility into build performance

**Mitigation**:
- Extend existing monitoring to track Turborepo metrics
- Create dashboards for cache hit rates and build times
- Set up alerts for build failures and performance degradation

### 8. TECH-003: Package-specific configuration issues

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Individual package configs are straightforward
**Impact**: Low - Minor adjustments may be needed

**Mitigation**:
- Test each package configuration independently
- Create configuration templates for consistency
- Document package-specific requirements and dependencies

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Build Pipeline Validation**: Test complete build process with all task dependencies
- **Dependency Chain Testing**: Validate upstream/downstream package dependencies
- **Rollback Procedure Testing**: Test reverting to original build system
- **Cache Invalidation Testing**: Verify cache clears correctly on source changes

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **CI/CD Integration Testing**: Validate GitHub Actions workflow changes
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare build times before/after migration
- **Cache Effectiveness Testing**: Test cache hit rates across different scenarios
- **Build Artifact Verification**: Ensure output consistency and correctness

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Development Workflow Testing**: Validate hot reload and watch modes
- **Package Configuration Testing**: Test individual package turbo.json configs
- **Monitoring Integration Testing**: Validate build metrics and alerting
- **Documentation Accuracy Testing**: Verify all commands and procedures work

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9) - TECH-001 build system dependency configuration
- High risks affecting build correctness - DATA-001 cache corruption

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with monitoring - OPS-001 CI/CD integration, PERF-001 performance
- Low risks with documentation in place - TECH-002, TECH-003, OPS-002

### Accepted Risks

- BUS-001 learning curve risk (accept as temporary productivity loss during transition)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Build Performance**: Build duration, cache hit rates, parallel execution efficiency
- **CI/CD Metrics**: Build success rates, deployment times, cache effectiveness
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reload functionality, watch mode performance
- **Cache Management**: Cache size, invalidation frequency, storage usage
- **Error Rates**: Build failures, task timeouts, dependency resolution errors

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Task dependency chains are modified
- Cache configuration is optimized
- New packages are added to monorepo
- CI/CD pipeline changes significantly
- Performance targets are not met
- Developer feedback indicates workflow issues

## Gate Recommendation

**Gate Decision: CONCERNS**

**Rationale**: One critical risk (TECH-001) must be addressed before production deployment. Three high risks (OPS-001, PERF-001, DATA-001) require mitigation strategies and comprehensive testing. With proper risk mitigation and testing plan, this story can proceed safely.

**Critical Actions Required:**
1. Implement comprehensive build dependency testing
2. Create rollback procedures and test them thoroughly
3. Set up CI/CD integration testing environment
4. Implement performance benchmarking and monitoring
