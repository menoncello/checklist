# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Story: 1.11 - Replace Compromised NPM Packages with Ansis - Security Fix

### Coverage Summary

- Total Requirements: 10 Acceptance Criteria
- Fully Covered: 0 (0%)
- Partially Covered: 3 (30%)
- Not Covered: 7 (70%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: Replace chalk package with ansis in all CLI commands

**Coverage: NONE**

No automated tests found that verify the replacement of chalk with ansis. The migrate.test.ts file is currently skipped and doesn't test the actual color output implementation.

**Gap**: No test validates that ansis is used instead of chalk
**Risk**: HIGH - Could miss chalk imports if added in other files
**Action**: Add integration test to verify ansis is the color library in use

#### AC2: Maintain identical color output formatting (green, red, cyan, yellow, white, gray)

**Coverage: NONE**

Given-When-Then Mappings:
- No tests found that verify color output

**Gap**: No visual regression tests for CLI color output
**Risk**: HIGH - Color output changes could impact user experience
**Action**: Implement visual regression tests or snapshot tests for colored output

#### AC3: Update all import statements from chalk to ansis

**Coverage: NONE**

No tests verify the correct import statements are used.

**Gap**: No static analysis or linting rules to prevent chalk imports
**Risk**: MEDIUM - Developers could accidentally reintroduce chalk
**Action**: Add ESLint rule to ban chalk imports

#### AC4: Existing CLI commands continue to work unchanged

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `migrate.test.ts` (currently skipped)
  - Given: Various migration scenarios
  - When: Migration commands are executed
  - Then: Commands complete successfully
  - **Note**: Tests are skipped due to CI timeout issues

The tests exist but are not running, providing theoretical but not actual coverage.

#### AC5: New ansis implementation follows existing terminal styling patterns

**Coverage: NONE**

No tests verify that the styling patterns are consistent with the existing codebase patterns.

**Gap**: No architectural or pattern compliance tests
**Risk**: LOW - Code review should catch pattern violations
**Action**: Document styling patterns and add code review checklist

#### AC6: Integration with CLI output maintains current visual behavior

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Integration Test**: `migrate.test.ts::various scenarios` (skipped)
  - Given: Migration command execution
  - When: Commands output messages
  - Then: Output is displayed (but color not verified)

Tests verify command execution but not visual output.

#### AC7: Change is covered by existing CLI tests

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Existing tests are present but:
- Tests are currently skipped (describe.skip)
- Tests don't verify color output specifically
- Tests focus on migration logic, not presentation

**Gap**: Tests exist but are disabled and don't cover the color output aspect
**Risk**: HIGH - Changes not validated by automated tests
**Action**: Fix CI timeout issues and enable tests

#### AC8: No security vulnerabilities from compromised packages

**Coverage: NONE**

No automated security scanning tests found in the test suite.

**Gap**: No test validates security audit results
**Risk**: CRITICAL - Could have vulnerable dependencies
**Action**: Add security audit step to CI/CD pipeline with test that fails on vulnerabilities

#### AC9: No regression in CLI output formatting verified

**Coverage: NONE**

No regression tests for CLI output formatting exist.

**Gap**: No before/after comparison tests
**Risk**: MEDIUM - Manual verification only
**Action**: Implement snapshot testing for CLI output

#### AC10: Security audit passes without critical vulnerabilities

**Coverage: NONE**

No test validates that `bun audit` returns clean results.

**Gap**: No automated security audit validation
**Risk**: CRITICAL - Security issues could go unnoticed
**Action**: Add test that runs security audit and fails on vulnerabilities

### Critical Gaps

1. **Security Validation**
   - Gap: No automated tests for security audit results
   - Risk: CRITICAL - Compromised packages could remain undetected
   - Action: Implement security audit test that fails on vulnerabilities

2. **Visual Regression**
   - Gap: No tests verify color output remains identical
   - Risk: HIGH - User experience could be impacted
   - Action: Implement snapshot or visual regression tests for CLI output

3. **Disabled Test Suite**
   - Gap: migrate.test.ts is skipped due to CI issues
   - Risk: HIGH - Core functionality not tested
   - Action: Fix CI timeout issues and enable test suite

4. **Import Prevention**
   - Gap: No mechanism to prevent reintroduction of chalk
   - Risk: MEDIUM - Developers could accidentally add chalk back
   - Action: Add ESLint rule to ban chalk imports

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Security Audit Test** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   ```typescript
   test('should have no security vulnerabilities', async () => {
     const result = await $`bun audit`.quiet();
     expect(result.exitCode).toBe(0);
     expect(result.stdout).not.toContain('critical');
     expect(result.stdout).not.toContain('high');
   });
   ```

2. **Import Validation Test** (Priority: HIGH)
   ```typescript
   test('should not import chalk anywhere in codebase', async () => {
     const result = await $`grep -r "from 'chalk'" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"`.quiet();
     expect(result.stdout).toBe('');
   });
   ```

3. **Color Output Snapshot Test** (Priority: HIGH)
   ```typescript
   test('migrate command color output', () => {
     const output = captureMigrateOutput();
     expect(output).toMatchSnapshot();
   });
   ```

4. **Dependency Check Test** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   ```typescript
   test('should not have compromised packages in dependencies', async () => {
     const compromised = ['chalk', 'color-name', 'color-convert', 'debug', 'ansi-styles'];
     const result = await $`bun pm ls`.quiet();
     compromised.forEach(pkg => {
       expect(result.stdout).not.toContain(pkg);
     });
   });
   ```

### Risk Assessment

- **CRITICAL Risk**: Security requirements (AC8, AC10) have no test coverage
- **HIGH Risk**: Core functionality tests are disabled (AC7)
- **HIGH Risk**: Visual output changes not validated (AC2, AC6, AC9)
- **MEDIUM Risk**: No prevention of chalk reintroduction (AC3)
- **LOW Risk**: Pattern compliance relies on manual review (AC5)

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Enable the skipped migrate.test.ts suite
   - Add security audit validation test
   - Implement dependency check test

2. **Short-term Actions**:
   - Add snapshot tests for CLI output
   - Implement ESLint rule to ban chalk
   - Add visual regression tests

3. **Long-term Actions**:
   - Establish security testing standards
   - Create reusable security test utilities
   - Document color output patterns

### Quality Gate Impact

This traceability analysis reveals significant gaps that should result in:
- **Security Gate**: FAIL (no automated security validation)
- **Functional Gate**: CONCERNS (tests exist but disabled)
- **Overall Recommendation**: CONCERNS with requirement to address security testing gaps immediately
