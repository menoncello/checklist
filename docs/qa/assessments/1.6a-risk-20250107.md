## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. DATA-001: Concurrent State Corruption

### 2. DATA-002: WAL Replay Failures

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Crashes during transactions are realistic scenarios
**Impact**: High - Failed recovery leads to data loss
**Mitigation**:
- Implement checksum validation for WAL entries

- Create automatic backup before replay
- Test with corrupted WAL scenarios
**Testing Focus**: Simulated crashes mid-transaction, corrupted WAL recovery

## High Risk Areas

### 1. PERF-001: Transaction Performance Degradation

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - WAL overhead may impact performance
**Impact**: High - Fails 100ms requirement, blocks UI
**Mitigation**:

**Testing Focus**: Benchmark with 1000 concurrent operations

### 2. OPS-001: Platform-Specific Locking Issues

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Windows/Unix differences are common
**Impact**: Medium - Feature may not work on all platforms
**Mitigation**:

### 3. TECH-001: Race Conditions in Lock Acquisition

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Complex timing scenarios
**Impact**: High - Multiple processes may acquire same lock
**Mitigation**:

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Concurrent Access Suite**: 10+ processes attempting simultaneous writes
- **Crash Recovery Suite**: Kill process at various transaction stages
- **WAL Corruption Suite**: Manually corrupt WAL files and test recovery
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Ensure <100ms transaction time under load

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests  
- **Cross-Platform Suite**: Test on Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Race Condition Suite**: Artificial delays to expose timing issues
- **Lock Timeout Suite**: Test acquisition timeout and retry logic
- **Stale Lock Suite**: Test detection and cleanup of abandoned locks

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Validation Suite**: Schema validation edge cases
- **Resource Suite**: Memory and disk usage monitoring
- **Permission Suite**: File permission error handling
- **Edge Case Suite**: Disk full, read-only filesystem

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- DATA-001: Concurrent state corruption (Critical)
- DATA-002: WAL replay failures (Critical)
- PERF-001: Must meet 100ms requirement

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- OPS-001: Document platform limitations
- TECH-001: Monitor lock acquisition metrics
- Medium risks with error handling and monitoring

### Accepted Risks
- Low probability events with graceful degradation
- Platform edge cases with documented workarounds

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Performance Metrics**: Transaction time p50/p95/p99
- **Lock Metrics**: Acquisition time, timeout rate, contention
- **WAL Metrics**: Replay frequency, corruption detection
- **Error Rates**: Lock failures, validation errors, recovery attempts
- **Resource Usage**: Memory consumption, disk I/O, file handles

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Performance degradation observed in production
- Platform-specific issues reported
- Concurrent access patterns change
- State schema becomes more complex
- Recovery failures occur in production

## Risk-Based Recommendations

### Testing Priority
1. Focus on concurrent access and crash recovery first
2. Implement chaos engineering tests for resilience
3. Use property-based testing for edge cases
4. Continuous performance benchmarking

### Development Focus
1. Robust error handling with circuit breakers
2. Comprehensive logging for debugging
3. Platform abstraction layer for portability
4. Performance profiling and optimization

### Deployment Strategy
1. Gradual rollout with feature flags
2. Canary deployment to detect issues early
3. Automated rollback on error spike
4. Pre-production stress testing

### Monitoring Setup
1. Real-time transaction performance dashboard
2. Lock contention heatmap
3. WAL recovery success rate tracking
4. Alert on transaction time > 100ms

## Residual Risk Assessment

After implementing all mitigations:
- **Estimated Risk Score**: 75/100 (Acceptable)
- **Remaining Concerns**: Edge cases in extreme load
- **Contingency Plan**: Manual recovery procedures documented
