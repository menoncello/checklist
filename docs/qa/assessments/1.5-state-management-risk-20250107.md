## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. DATA-001: State Corruption During Concurrent Access

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Multiple CLI instances or processes will likely access state files simultaneously
**Impact**: High - Complete workflow state loss, requiring full restart and loss of progress
**Mitigation**:
- Implement robust file locking mechanism with proper acquire/release semantics
- Add process ID and hostname to lock files for debugging
- Implement lock timeout detection (recommended: 5 seconds)
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
**Testing Focus**: 
- Concurrent access stress testing with multiple processes
- Lock timeout and recovery scenarios
- Stale lock detection and cleanup

### 2. DATA-002: Atomic Write Failure Leading to Data Loss

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - File system operations commonly fail during writes (disk full, permissions, crashes)
**Impact**: High - Partial writes result in corrupted YAML files, making state unrecoverable
**Mitigation**:
- Strict implementation of temp file + atomic rename strategy
- Verify temp file write completion before rename
- Implement fsync() equivalent to ensure disk writes
- Add rollback mechanism on write failures
**Testing Focus**:
- Simulate disk full scenarios
- Test power failure simulation during writes
- Verify temp file cleanup on errors

## High Risks

### 3. PERF-001: Performance Degradation Under Load

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - YAML parsing/serialization is CPU-intensive
**Impact**: Medium - Operations exceed 50ms SLA, degrading user experience
**Mitigation**:
- Implement lazy loading of state sections
- Add in-memory caching with TTL
- Consider binary format for internal operations
- Profile and optimize hot paths
**Testing Focus**:
- Load testing with large state files (>10MB)
- Benchmark all operations against 50ms threshold
- Profile CPU and memory usage

### 4. SEC-001: Insufficient Schema Validation

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Malformed data could bypass validation
**Impact**: High - Invalid state could crash application or cause security issues
**Mitigation**:
- Implement strict Ajv schema with additionalProperties: false
- Validate on every read and write operation
- Add schema versioning for backward compatibility
- Implement safe defaults for missing fields
**Testing Focus**:
- Fuzz testing with malformed YAML
- Schema boundary testing
- Version migration testing

## Medium Risks

### 5. TECH-001: Migration System Failures

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - State schema will evolve over time
**Impact**: Medium - Users unable to upgrade, stuck on old versions
**Mitigation**:
- Design comprehensive migration registry
- Implement bidirectional migrations where possible
- Add dry-run mode for migrations
- Keep migration history in state
**Testing Focus**:
- Test all migration paths
- Verify rollback capabilities
- Test skip-version upgrades

### 6. OPS-001: Backup Retention Issues

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Long-running workflows generate many backups
**Impact**: Medium - Disk space exhaustion, loss of recovery capability
**Mitigation**:
- Implement intelligent backup pruning (keep last 10 + daily for week)
- Add disk space monitoring
- Compress older backups
- Add backup integrity verification
**Testing Focus**:
- Test backup rotation logic
- Verify recovery from various backup points
- Test disk space edge cases

## Low Risks

### 7. OPS-002: Lock File Cleanup Failures

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Process crashes are uncommon
**Impact**: High - All state operations blocked until manual intervention
**Mitigation**:
- Implement PID-based stale lock detection
- Add automatic cleanup after timeout (30 seconds)
- Provide manual lock clearing command
- Log all lock operations for debugging
**Testing Focus**:
- Test process crash scenarios
- Verify stale lock detection
- Test manual cleanup procedures

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Concurrent Access Testing**
  - Spawn 10+ processes simultaneously accessing state
  - Test lock acquisition/release timing
  - Verify no data corruption under contention
  
- **Atomic Write Testing**
  - Simulate failures at each write stage
  - Test recovery from partial writes
  - Verify backup restoration process

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Performance Testing**
  - Benchmark all operations with Tinybench
  - Test with varying state file sizes (1KB to 100MB)
  - Profile memory usage and GC pressure
  
- **Security Testing**
  - Fuzz test with malformed YAML inputs
  - Test schema validation boundaries
  - Verify no code injection via YAML

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Migration Testing**
  - Test all version upgrade paths
  - Verify backward compatibility
  
- **Operational Testing**
  - Test backup rotation and cleanup
  - Verify lock timeout mechanisms

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- DATA-001: Concurrent access protection MUST be bulletproof
- DATA-002: Atomic writes MUST be guaranteed
- PERF-001: MUST meet <50ms performance requirement

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- SEC-001: If comprehensive input validation in place
- TECH-001: If migration documentation complete
- OPS-001: If monitoring alerts configured

### Accepted Risks
- OPS-002: Can accept with documented manual cleanup procedure

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Performance Metrics**: Operation latency P50/P95/P99
- **Error Rates**: Write failures, lock timeouts, corruption events
- **Resource Usage**: Disk space, file handle count
- **Concurrency Metrics**: Lock wait time, contention rate

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- State file format changes
- Concurrency model changes
- Performance requirements change
- New storage backends added
- Security vulnerabilities discovered

## Recommendations

### Testing Priority
1. Focus on concurrent access scenarios first
2. Implement chaos testing for file system failures
3. Add performance regression tests in CI

### Development Focus
1. Implement file locking before any other feature
2. Add comprehensive error handling and recovery
3. Include detailed debug logging for troubleshooting

### Deployment Strategy
1. Deploy with feature flag initially
2. Monitor closely for first 48 hours
3. Have rollback plan ready
4. Document all failure scenarios and recovery procedures
