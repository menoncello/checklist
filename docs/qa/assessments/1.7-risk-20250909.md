## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- **Platform Compatibility Testing**: Test performance baselines across macOS, Linux, Windows
- **Memory Leak Detection**: Long-running tests with metric collection active
- **Performance Monitoring Overhead**: Benchmark with/without monitoring enabled
- **Data Storage Growth**: Simulate weeks of metric collection
- **Budget Enforcement Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions, invalid inputs
- **CI Environment Characterization**: Statistical analysis of CI performance variance

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- **Feature Utility Assessment**: Usage analytics for monitoring features

### Priority 3: Standard Tests
- **Functional Testing**: All acceptance criteria verification
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end performance monitoring workflow

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- **PERF-001**: Monitoring overhead must not exceed 5% of operation time
- **PERF-002**: Memory usage must stay within defined budgets
- **DATA-001**: Data growth must be bounded with retention policies
