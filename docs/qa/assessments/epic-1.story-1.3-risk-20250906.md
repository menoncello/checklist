Date: 2025-09-06
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 7
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 2
- Medium Risks: 3
- Low Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 57/100 (Moderate-High Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Framework Lock-in Risk

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Early testing framework decisions will establish patterns used throughout the project lifecycle. Changing testing tools later would require significant refactoring.
**Impact**: High - Wrong framework choice could impact development velocity, test reliability, and maintenance costs for the entire project.
**Mitigation**:
- Validate Bun test compatibility with all planned features before full commitment
- Create abstraction layer for test utilities to ease potential migration
- Document framework limitations and have contingency plans
- Run proof-of-concept tests for critical features (TUI testing, visual regression)

**Testing Focus**: 
- Validate Bun test with terminal emulation (node-pty)
- Verify snapshot testing capabilities for terminal output
- Test cross-package test execution in monorepo
- Confirm coverage reporting accuracy

## High Priority Risks

### 2. TECH-002: Monorepo Test Complexity

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Multiple packages with interdependencies create complex test scenarios
**Impact**: Medium - Could slow development and create maintenance burden
**Mitigation**:
- Establish clear test boundaries between packages
- Use TestDataFactory for consistent test data across packages
- Document cross-package testing patterns
- Implement proper test isolation

### 3. OPS-001: CI/CD Pipeline Failure

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: Medium - Different OS environments may have varying behaviors
**Impact**: High - Failed CI/CD blocks deployments and slows development
**Mitigation**:
- Test early on all target platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows WSL)
- Use Docker containers for consistent test environments
- Implement graceful fallbacks for platform-specific features
- Add retry logic for flaky tests

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Framework Validation Tests**
  - Bun test runner compatibility with all package types
  - Terminal emulation and snapshot testing
  - Coverage reporting accuracy validation
  - Cross-platform execution verification

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Integration Testing**
  - Cross-package dependency tests
  - Monorepo workspace resolution tests
  - CI/CD pipeline integration tests
  - Multi-platform compatibility tests

### Priority 3: Medium Risk Tests
- **Performance Tests**
  - Test suite execution time benchmarks
  - Pre-commit hook performance validation
  - Coverage calculation performance
- **Security Tests**
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning
  - Test data sanitization validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- TECH-001: Framework must be validated for all critical features
- TECH-002: Clear test boundaries and patterns must be established
- OPS-001: CI/CD must work reliably on all platforms

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- PERF-001: Can accept slower tests initially with optimization plan
- DATA-001: Can iterate on TestDataFactory design
- SEC-001: Can enhance security testing incrementally

### Accepted Risks
- BUS-001: Some over-engineering acceptable for robustness

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-implementation monitoring for:
- Test execution times (target: <2min for full suite)
- Test flakiness rate (target: <1%)
- Coverage metrics (maintain >80%)
- CI/CD success rate (target: >95%)
- Pre-commit hook execution time (target: <30s)

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Adding new testing tools or frameworks
- Significant monorepo structure changes
- Test suite execution exceeds 5 minutes
- CI/CD failure rate exceeds 10%
- New package types added to monorepo

## Recommendations

### Testing Priority
1. Validate Bun test with proof-of-concept for TUI testing
2. Establish monorepo test patterns early
3. Set up CI/CD with all platforms from start
4. Implement performance benchmarks immediately

### Development Focus
1. Create abstraction layer for test utilities
2. Document all testing patterns thoroughly
3. Establish clear package boundaries
4. Implement robust test data management

### Deployment Strategy
1. Deploy testing framework incrementally by package
2. Use feature flags for new test types
3. Maintain fallback to simpler test approaches
4. Document rollback procedures for test changes

### Monitoring Setup
1. Track test execution metrics from day one
2. Set up alerts for test suite degradation
3. Monitor coverage trends
4. Track flaky test occurrences
