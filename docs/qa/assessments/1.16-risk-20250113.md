### 2. PERF-001: Performance Degradation from Code Splitting

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Splitting large files and extracting functions adds overhead
**Impact**: High - Could violate <10ms rendering requirement and 60fps target
**Mitigation**:
- Profile performance before and after each refactoring

- Optimize hot paths with performance monitoring
- Consider inline functions for critical performance areas
**Testing Focus**:
- Benchmark terminal rendering performance

- Profile memory usage patterns

## High Risk Areas

### 3. TECH-002: CI/CD Pipeline Disruption

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - New quality gates may conflict with existing CI
**Impact**: High - Could block all deployments and development
**Mitigation**:
- Test CI changes in separate branch first
- Implement gradual rollout of quality checks
- Add bypass mechanism for emergencies
- Document rollback procedures

### 4. DATA-001: Loss of Test Coverage

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Refactoring often breaks existing tests
**Impact**: Medium - Could drop mutation score below 85% threshold
**Mitigation**:
- Update tests incrementally with refactoring
- Monitor coverage metrics continuously
- Fix test failures immediately
- Add new tests for extracted functions

### 5. OPS-001: Developer Productivity Impact

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Strict quality rules slow down development
**Impact**: Medium - Team velocity could decrease significantly
**Mitigation**:
- Provide clear exemption process
- Create IDE snippets for common patterns
- Automate fixes where possible
- Training on clean code practices

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

**For TECH-001 (Breaking Code):**
- Full regression test suite after each refactoring
- Smoke tests for all critical user journeys
- Integration tests for package boundaries
- Manual testing of all CLI commands
- Visual regression for TUI components

**For PERF-001 (Performance):**
- Benchmark suite before/after refactoring
- Load test with 10,000 checklist items
- Profile CPU and memory usage
- Measure frame rates during scrolling
- Test startup time with large state files

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

**For TECH-002 (CI/CD):**
- Test GitHub Actions workflow in fork
- Verify all quality gates trigger correctly
- Test bypass mechanisms work
- Validate artifact upload

**For DATA-001 (Coverage):**
- Monitor mutation score continuously
- Verify coverage reports generate
- Test coverage threshold enforcement
- Validate test file discovery

**For OPS-001 (Productivity):**
- Time common development tasks
- Test exemption approval flow
- Verify auto-fix capabilities
- Measure pre-commit hook duration

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Standard unit tests for utilities
- Linting rule validation
- Documentation generation tests
- Security scanning for dependencies

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- TECH-001: All packages must pass existing tests
- PERF-001: Performance benchmarks must pass
- Test coverage must remain above 85% (mutation)
- All critical user journeys must work

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Pre-commit hooks can be bypassed if needed
- Some complexity warnings can be suppressed
- Non-critical performance degradation (<10%)
- Documentation gaps for internal functions

### Accepted Risks

- Minor increase in development friction
- Some legacy code may need exemptions
- Learning curve for new quality standards

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance metrics**: Terminal rendering FPS, command response times
- **Quality metrics**: ESLint violations per commit, complexity trends
- **Developer metrics**: Time to commit, bypass frequency
- **Build metrics**: CI pipeline duration, failure rates
- **Test metrics**: Coverage trends, mutation score evolution

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Major architecture changes proposed
- New packages added to monorepo
- Performance benchmarks fail
- Developer complaints increase
- External dependencies updated

## Recommendations

### Testing Priority
1. Create comprehensive test harness before refactoring
2. Implement performance benchmarking suite
3. Add visual regression tests for TUI
4. Set up continuous coverage monitoring

### Development Focus
1. Start with shared package (lowest risk)
2. Refactor incrementally with tests
3. Profile performance after each change
4. Document exemption requests

### Deployment Strategy
1. Deploy to staging environment first
2. Use feature flags for quality gates
3. Implement gradual rollout by package
4. Maintain rollback procedures

### Monitoring Setup
1. Dashboard for quality metrics
2. Alerts for performance regression
3. Track developer productivity metrics
4. Monitor test execution times
