### Critical Gaps

None identified - all critical acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage.

### Minor Gaps

1. **Nested Transactions**
   - Gap: No explicit parent-child transaction relationship tests
   - Risk: Low - Current architecture supports unique transaction IDs
   - Action: Add nested transaction test scenarios if feature is needed

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on the excellent coverage identified:

1. **Additional scenarios to consider**:
   - Nested transaction rollback scenarios
   - WAL compaction for very long-running transactions
   - Multi-process concurrent WAL access

2. **Test maintenance**:
   - Continue comprehensive performance benchmarking
   - Maintain crash simulation tests
   - Keep edge case coverage current

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None - All critical paths fully covered
- **Medium Risk**: None - Performance targets validated
- **Low Risk**: Nested transactions (partial coverage, architectural support exists)

### Quality Indicators

âœ… **Excellent traceability achieved**:
- Every acceptance criterion has multiple test levels
- Critical paths have unit + integration + performance tests  
- Edge cases explicitly covered with dedicated tests
- Clear Given-When-Then mappings for all requirements
- Performance targets validated through benchmarks

### Test Coverage Distribution

- **Unit Tests**: 20+ test cases in WriteAheadLog.test.ts
- **Integration Tests**: 15+ scenarios in wal-crash-recovery.test.ts
- **Transaction Tests**: 27+ test cases in TransactionCoordinator.test.ts
- **Performance Tests**: 12+ benchmarks in wal-performance.bench.ts

Total test coverage demonstrates comprehensive validation of the WAL implementation with multi-layered testing approach.
