#### Package.json Scripts

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

- `test`: Indirectly validated (tests are running)
- `typecheck`: Tested in smoke tests

- `quality`: Not tested
- `prepare`: Not tested

### Critical Gaps

1. **Build System**
   - Gap: No tests for build scripts or output
   - Risk: High - Build may fail in production
   - Action: Add tests for `bun run build` and verify dist/ output

2. **Performance Budgets**
   - Gap: No validation of performance.config.ts
   - Risk: Medium - Performance requirements not enforced
   - Action: Create tests that validate budget configuration

3. **Documentation**
   - Gap: No validation of README presence or content
   - Risk: Low - Developer experience impact
   - Action: Add test to verify README.md exists with setup steps

4. **Package Linking**
   - Gap: Only core package has tests, others untested
   - Risk: Medium - Package interdependencies may break
   - Action: Add smoke tests for cli, tui, and shared packages

5. **VSCode Configuration**
   - Gap: No tests for .vscode settings
   - Risk: Low - Team consistency impact
   - Action: Add tests to verify settings.json and extensions.json exist

6. **Quality Script**
   - Gap: Combined quality check script not tested
   - Risk: Medium - Pre-commit validation may miss issues
   - Action: Add test for `bun run quality` command

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Build Tests** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Test each package builds successfully
   - Verify dist/ directories are created
   - Check TypeScript declaration files generated
   - Validate binary output size against budget

2. **Integration Tests** (Priority: MEDIUM)  
   - Test workspace package imports work
   - Verify packages can use each other
   - Test CLI package can import from core
   - Test TUI package can import from shared

3. **Configuration Tests** (Priority: LOW)
   - Verify all config files are present
   - Test VSCode settings are valid JSON
   - Check performance.config.ts exports expected structure

4. **Documentation Tests** (Priority: LOW)
   - Verify README.md exists
   - Check for required sections in README
   - Validate setup instructions are present

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Build system untested (AC5), Performance budgets undefined (AC8)
- **Medium Risk**: Package directories partially tested (AC4), Quality script untested
- **Low Risk**: TypeScript compilation (AC2), Git setup (AC6), Linting/Formatting tools

### NFR Coverage Analysis

- **Performance**: No tests for startup time, memory usage, or binary size budgets
- **Security**: Pre-commit secrets scanning tested
- **Maintainability**: Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier) tested
- **Reliability**: No tests for error handling or recovery
- **Compatibility**: Node.js fallback tested, Bun version checked

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Add build system tests for all packages
   - Create performance budget validation tests
   - Add integration tests for package imports

2. **Short-term Actions**:
   - Add tests for all package.json scripts
   - Create tests for workspace configuration
   - Add README validation test

3. **Long-term Actions**:
   - Implement performance benchmarking
   - Add dependency security scanning tests
   - Create developer environment validation suite
