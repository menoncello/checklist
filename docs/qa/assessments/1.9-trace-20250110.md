  - When: Overlay is shown with positioned content
  - Then: Overlay is displayed at specified position

#### AC6: Split-pane view capability

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `ViewSystem.test.ts::should handle split view navigation`
  - Given: Two registered views for splitting
  - When: splitView method is called with view IDs
  - Then: Layout switches to split mode with both views active

- **Unit Test**: `ViewSystem.test.ts::should throw error for split view with non-existent views`
  - Given: Request to split with invalid view IDs
  - When: splitView is called with non-existent views
  - Then: Error is thrown with clear message

#### AC7: Tab-based view switching

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

**Gap**: No specific tests found for tab-based view switching functionality. Layout tests cover layout types but not tab-specific behavior.

#### AC8: Keyboard shortcuts for view navigation

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `BaseView.test.ts` (implied from MockView implementation)
  - Given: View with defined key bindings
  - When: getKeyBindings is called
  - Then: Key binding definitions are returned

**Gap**: No integration tests for actual keyboard shortcut handling during navigation

#### AC9: View transition animations (if TUI supports)

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `ViewSystem.test.ts::should trigger resize on layout change`
  - Given: Active view in ViewSystem
  - When: Layout is changed
  - Then: View resize is triggered (potential animation hook)

**Gap**: No specific animation tests or TUI animation capability validation

#### AC10: Responsive layout adjustment

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `ViewSystem.test.ts::should trigger resize on layout change`
  - Given: View with active layout
  - When: Layout change occurs
  - Then: Resize event is triggered on view

**Gap**: No tests for terminal size detection or responsive breakpoints

### Critical Gaps

1. **Layout Component Testing**
   - Gap: Missing tests for header/footer layout components
   - Risk: Medium - Layout structure might not work correctly
   - Action: Add tests for layout component rendering and behavior

2. **Tab Switching Implementation**
   - Gap: No tab-based switching tests found
   - Risk: High - Tab functionality may not be implemented
   - Action: Verify tab implementation exists and add comprehensive tests

3. **Keyboard Navigation Integration**
   - Gap: No integration tests for keyboard shortcut handling
   - Risk: Medium - Shortcuts may not work in real usage
   - Action: Add end-to-end keyboard navigation tests

4. **Responsive Layout Logic**
   - Gap: No terminal resize detection or responsive breakpoint tests
   - Risk: Medium - App may not adapt to terminal size changes
   - Action: Add tests for terminal size detection and layout adaptation

5. **Animation Support Validation**
   - Gap: No validation of TUI animation capabilities
   - Risk: Low - Animations are optional feature
   - Action: Add capability detection tests if animations are required

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Layout Component Tests**
   - Unit tests for header/footer component rendering
   - Integration tests for layout pattern consistency
   - Tests for layout switching with content preservation

2. **Tab Switching Implementation**
   - Unit tests for tab navigation logic
   - Integration tests for tab-based view management
   - Keyboard shortcut tests for tab switching

3. **Responsive Layout Tests**
   - Mock terminal resize events
   - Test layout adaptation algorithms
   - Validate responsive breakpoint behavior

4. **End-to-End Navigation Tests**
   - Complete navigation flow testing
   - Keyboard shortcut integration
   - State preservation across complex navigation scenarios

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Tab-based view switching (AC7) - Core functionality may be missing
- **Medium Risk**: Layout components (AC4), keyboard navigation (AC8), responsive layout (AC10) - Important features with partial coverage
- **Low Risk**: Animation support (AC9) - Optional feature with acceptable coverage

### Performance Coverage

From Dev Notes performance requirements:
- View switching: <50ms - **Partially tested** via navigation tests
- State save/restore: <10ms - **Tested** via state management tests
- Layout change: <30ms - **Partially tested** via layout change tests
- Support 10+ concurrent views - **Not tested**

**Recommendation**: Add performance benchmarks to existing test suite to validate timing requirements.

### Integration Dependencies

Tests validate integration with:
- ✅ State Management (Story 1.5) - State preservation tests present
- ✅ Terminal Canvas (Story 1.8) - View rendering tests present
- ⚠️ IoC Container (Story 1.13) - No dependency injection tests found

**Recommendation**: Add tests for ViewSystem registration and injection via IoC container.
