# NFR Assessment: 1.1

Date: 2025-09-05
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - Missing authentication/authorization setup, no rate limiting
- Performance: PASS - Performance budgets defined with reasonable targets
- Reliability: CONCERNS - No error handling framework established yet
- Maintainability: PASS - Strong code quality tooling and standards in place

## Critical Issues

1. **No authentication/authorization framework** (Security)
   - Risk: Story sets up project structure without security foundation
   - Fix: While auth isn't needed for CLI tool, secure state management patterns should be established
   - Note: This is acceptable for initial setup story but needs addressing in subsequent stories

2. **No error handling patterns established** (Reliability)
   - Risk: Project structure lacks error handling framework
   - Fix: Add error handling utilities to shared package
   - Severity: Medium - acceptable for setup story

## Assessment Details

### Security (CONCERNS)

**Findings:**
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks include security audit (`bun audit`)
- ✅ Secret scanning patterns in pre-commit hook (per test evidence)
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in configuration
- ✅ ESLint security rules configured (no-eval, no-implied-eval)
- ❌ No authentication framework setup
- ❌ No rate limiting middleware configured
- ❌ No input validation library included

**Assessment:** CONCERNS - While basic security practices are in place (audit, linting), the project structure doesn't establish security patterns. This is somewhat acceptable for an initial setup story but should be addressed early.

### Performance (PASS)

**Findings:**
- ✅ Performance budgets clearly defined in `performance.config.ts`
- ✅ Reasonable targets: 50ms startup, 30MB memory, 10ms operations
- ✅ Maximum thresholds set: 100ms startup, 50MB memory, 100ms operations
- ✅ Binary size budget: 15MB target, 20MB max
- ✅ Bun runtime optimized for performance
- ⚠️ No performance monitoring setup (acceptable for initial story)

**Assessment:** PASS - Performance requirements are well-defined with specific, measurable targets appropriate for a CLI tool.

### Reliability (CONCERNS)

**Findings:**
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode reduces runtime errors
- ✅ Test infrastructure established
- ❌ No error handling framework in shared package
- ❌ No logging infrastructure setup
- ❌ No retry patterns established
- ❌ No health check mechanisms

**Assessment:** CONCERNS - Basic reliability through TypeScript, but lacks error handling patterns. This is typical for initial setup but needs immediate follow-up.

### Maintainability (PASS)

**Findings:**
- ✅ Monorepo structure with clear package separation
- ✅ TypeScript with strict configuration
- ✅ ESLint with comprehensive rules enforced
- ✅ Prettier for consistent formatting
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks ensure quality
- ✅ Test infrastructure in place
- ✅ VSCode settings for team consistency
- ✅ Clear package boundaries (@checklist/core, cli, tui, shared)
- ⚠️ Test coverage not measured yet (acceptable for setup)

**Assessment:** PASS - Excellent maintainability foundation with all essential tools and standards configured.

## Quick Wins

1. **Add error handling base classes** (~2 hours)
   - Create BaseError class in shared package
   - Add error codes enum
   - Implement error serialization

2. **Add basic logging setup** (~2 hours)
   - Configure debug/bunyan for structured logging
   - Add log levels configuration
   - Create logger factory

3. **Setup test coverage reporting** (~1 hour)
   - Configure coverage thresholds
   - Add coverage script to package.json
   - Include in quality checks

## Context-Specific Observations

This is a project setup story, so some NFR gaps are expected and acceptable:
- Security framework not needed yet for local CLI tool
- Error handling can be added as packages are developed
- Performance monitoring comes with actual functionality

The story successfully establishes:
- Strong development practices foundation
- Clear architectural boundaries
- Quality enforcement mechanisms
- Performance awareness from the start

## Recommendations for Next Stories

1. **Story 1.2** should establish:
   - Error handling patterns in shared package
   - Logging infrastructure
   - State encryption for sensitive data

2. **Story 1.3** should add:
   - Input validation utilities
   - Rate limiting for any API endpoints
   - Security patterns for state management

## Quality Score

Quality Score: **80/100**
- Security: -10 (missing frameworks, acceptable for setup)
- Reliability: -10 (missing error handling, typical for setup)
- Performance: 0 (well-defined budgets)
- Maintainability: 0 (excellent foundation)
