Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 15
- Critical Risks: 2
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 30/100 (High Risk - Immediate attention required)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. DATA-001: Irreversible Data Corruption During Migration

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Complex transformation logic with multiple migration paths increases likelihood of corruption
**Impact**: High (3) - Complete data loss or corruption could make checklists unusable
**Mitigation**:
- Implement atomic migration transactions with full rollback capability
- Create verified backups before any migration operation
- Add comprehensive validation after each migration step
- Implement checksums to verify data integrity pre/post migration
**Testing Focus**: Corruption simulation tests, rollback verification, data integrity validation

### 2. DATA-002: Failed Migration Path Discovery

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Multiple version jumps and complex path finding algorithm
**Impact**: High (3) - Users unable to upgrade, stuck on old versions
**Mitigation**:
- Thoroughly test Dijkstra's algorithm implementation for all edge cases
- Create fallback mechanisms for unknown versions
- Implement version detection heuristics with high accuracy
- Add comprehensive migration path testing for all version combinations
**Testing Focus**: Path finding edge cases, version skip scenarios, circular dependency detection

## High Risk Areas

### 1. TECH-001: Complex Migration Path Dependencies

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Sequential migrations may have interdependencies
**Impact**: High (3) - Failed intermediate migration could leave state inconsistent
**Mitigation**:
- Design migrations to be idempotent where possible
- Implement transaction boundaries for multi-step migrations
- Add intermediate state validation between migrations
**Testing Focus**: Multi-step migration scenarios, partial failure recovery

### 2. PERF-001: Large State File Migration Performance

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Files >10MB mentioned as concern
**Impact**: High (3) - Migration timeout or memory exhaustion
**Mitigation**:
- Implement streaming for large files
- Add progress indicators and chunked processing
- Set reasonable timeout limits (500ms target may be unrealistic for large files)
- Consider async migration with background processing
**Testing Focus**: Performance benchmarks with 1MB, 10MB, 100MB files

### 3. SEC-001: Path Traversal in Backup Operations

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - File operations with user-controlled paths
**Impact**: High (3) - Potential file system access outside intended directories
**Mitigation**:
- Sanitize all file paths before operations
- Use path.join() and validate against base directory
- Implement strict directory access controls
- Never use user input directly in file paths
**Testing Focus**: Path injection tests, directory traversal attempts

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

**Data Corruption Prevention**
- Test migration with intentionally corrupted input files
- Verify rollback works correctly on migration failure
- Test atomic transaction boundaries
- Validate checksums before and after migration
- Test with concurrent file modifications during migration

**Path Discovery Testing**
- Test all possible version upgrade paths (0.0.0 → 1.0.0, etc.)
- Test version skipping scenarios (0.0.0 → 0.2.0)
- Test with missing intermediate versions
- Test circular dependency detection
- Test with unknown/future version numbers

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

**Performance Testing**
- Benchmark with files: 100KB, 1MB, 10MB, 100MB
- Memory profiling during large migrations
- Test streaming implementation for large files
- Verify progress indicators update correctly
- Test timeout handling and recovery

**Security Testing**
- Path injection testing (../../../etc/passwd)
- Symbolic link traversal attempts
- Unicode/special character handling in paths
- Permission testing on backup directories
- Test with read-only file systems

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

**Integration Testing**
- Test with existing WAL and TransactionCoordinator
- Verify StateManager integration
- Test CLI command variations
- Test backup rotation mechanism
- Verify migration history tracking

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- All critical risks (DATA-001, DATA-002)
- Security path traversal risk (SEC-001)
- Performance issues with large files (PERF-001)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Complex dependency handling with proper testing
- Version detection with fallback mechanisms
- Sequential migration with progress indicators

### Accepted Risks
- Minor timestamp precision loss (acceptable for non-critical metadata)
- Some unclear error messages (can improve post-launch)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Migration success/failure rates
- Average migration duration by file size
- Memory usage during migrations
- Backup creation success rates
- Version detection accuracy
- Error rates by migration path

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Adding new migration paths
- Changing version detection logic
- Modifying backup/restore mechanisms
- Performance issues reported in production
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- State file format changes significantly

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Critical Data Protection**
   - Implement comprehensive backup verification before migration
   - Add atomic transaction support for all migration operations
   - Create data integrity validation suite

2. **Path Discovery Robustness**
   - Add extensive unit tests for Dijkstra's algorithm
   - Implement fallback mechanisms for unknown versions
   - Create migration path visualization tool for debugging

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Audit all file path operations for injection vulnerabilities
   - Implement strict input validation for all user-provided paths
   - Add security tests to CI/CD pipeline

### Testing Priorities

1. Create comprehensive test fixtures for all version combinations
2. Implement chaos testing for migration failures
3. Add performance regression tests
4. Create security test suite for file operations

### Architecture Improvements

1. Consider implementing migration as background job for large files
2. Add migration dry-run capability for validation
3. Implement migration health checks
4. Create migration rollback UI for user control
