### Critical Gaps

1. **Custom Validation (Partial)**
   - Gap: Custom validation disabled for security in MVP
   - Risk: Low - Intentional design decision
   - Action: Enable in post-MVP with sandboxing

2. **Full TransactionCoordinator Integration (Partial)**
   - Gap: Simplified transaction handling in MVP
   - Risk: Low - Basic atomicity still maintained
   - Action: Full integration pending Story 1.0 completion

3. **Plugin System (Not Covered)**
   - Gap: Plugin system not implemented
   - Risk: None - Documented as post-MVP feature
   - Action: Implement when extensibility needed

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

1. **Strengths:**
   - Comprehensive unit test coverage (32 tests)
   - Extensive integration testing (17 tests)
   - Performance validation under load
   - Error recovery scenarios well tested

2. **Additional Tests Recommended:**
   - Load test with 10,000 steps (performance boundary)
   - Stress test concurrent operations with 100+ threads
   - Extended memory leak test over 10,000 operations

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None identified
- **Medium Risk**: Transaction rollback scenarios (partially simplified)
- **Low Risk**: Custom validation disabled, plugin system deferred

Overall Risk Level: **LOW**

The implementation has excellent test coverage with 87.5% of requirements fully covered. The gaps are intentional MVP decisions with clear migration paths.
