## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Without proper filtering, developers will likely log sensitive data
**Impact**: High - PII/credentials in logs could lead to compliance violations and data breaches
**Mitigation**:
- Implement automatic PII detection and redaction
- Create allowlist of safe-to-log fields
- Add pre-commit hooks to scan for sensitive data patterns
- Regular audit of log files for sensitive data
**Testing Focus**: Security scanning of all log outputs, penetration testing of log endpoints

### 2. DATA-001: Log File Disk Exhaustion
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Production systems generate massive log volumes
**Impact**: High - Full disk causes system failure, service outage
**Mitigation**:
- Implement aggressive rotation policies (size and time-based)
- Add disk space monitoring with alerts at 70%, 85%, 95%
- Automatic cleanup of old logs
- Emergency fallback to stdout when disk is full
**Testing Focus**: Load testing with high log volume, disk space limit testing

## High Risk Items

### 3. PERF-001: Logging Performance Overhead
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Synchronous logging could block operations
**Impact**: High - Could violate 5ms per operation requirement
**Mitigation**:
- Use async logging with buffering
- Implement sampling for high-volume debug logs
- Lazy evaluation of expensive log parameters
**Testing Focus**: Performance benchmarking under load

### 4. TECH-001: Migration Complexity from Debug Library
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Debug is used throughout the codebase
**Impact**: Medium - Could break existing functionality if not migrated properly
**Mitigation**:
- Create automated migration script
- Implement compatibility layer during transition
- Phased migration with feature flags
**Testing Focus**: Regression testing of all migrated modules

### 5. OPS-001: StrykerJS CI Pipeline Timeout
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Large codebase may exceed timeout
**Impact**: High - CI/CD pipeline failure blocks deployments
**Mitigation**:
- Configure incremental mutation testing
- Optimize concurrency settings (4 threads)
- Implement timeout retry logic
- Cache mutation test results
**Testing Focus**: CI pipeline stress testing

### 6. SEC-002: Log Injection Attacks
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - User input could manipulate log entries
**Impact**: High - Log forgery, SIEM bypass
**Mitigation**:
- Sanitize all user inputs before logging
- Use structured logging format
- Validate log entry format
**Testing Focus**: Security testing with malicious inputs

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Security Scanning**: Automated PII detection in log outputs
- **Load Testing**: Generate 10GB+ of logs to test rotation and disk management
- **Stress Testing**: Concurrent logging from multiple processes
- **Chaos Testing**: Simulate disk full, permission denied scenarios

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Performance Testing**: Measure logging overhead under various loads
- **Migration Testing**: Validate Debug to Pino conversion accuracy
- **CI/CD Testing**: Run mutation tests on full codebase
- **Security Testing**: Log injection and tampering attempts

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Integration Testing**: 3rd party service connections
- **Edge Case Testing**: Corrupted files, network failures
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing functionality preserved

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- SEC-001: Sensitive data exposure (implement redaction)
- DATA-001: Disk exhaustion (implement rotation & monitoring)
- PERF-001: Must meet <5ms requirement

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- TECH-001: Phased migration acceptable with compatibility layer
- OPS-001: CI timeout acceptable with retry logic
- SEC-002: Log injection with input sanitization

### Accepted Risks
- PERF-003: Minor test slowdown acceptable
- TECH-003: Version conflicts manageable with lock files

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Performance Metrics**: Log operation latency (target <5ms)
- **Disk Usage**: Alert at 70%, 85%, 95% thresholds
- **Security Alerts**: PII detection, injection attempts
- **CI/CD Metrics**: Mutation test duration, failure rates
- **Error Rates**: Log rotation failures, service integration errors

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Log volume exceeds projected estimates
- New compliance requirements emerge
- Performance degradation observed
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in dependencies
- CI/CD pipeline consistently times out

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Implement PII detection and redaction mechanism
2. Configure aggressive log rotation with monitoring
3. Create performance benchmarks for logging operations
4. Set up compatibility layer for Debug → Pino migration

### Testing Priorities
1. Security scanning for sensitive data
2. Load testing for disk management
3. Performance testing for overhead validation
4. Migration testing for Debug replacement

### Deployment Strategy
1. Deploy logging infrastructure first with feature flags
2. Gradual rollout with monitoring
3. Mutation testing in staging before production
4. Keep rollback plan ready
