## High Risk Details

### PERF-002: Performance Budget Enforcement Gaps

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Performance budgets are defined but no automated enforcement mechanism exists
**Impact**: Medium - Could lead to gradual performance degradation going unnoticed
**Mitigation**:

- Implement performance testing in CI pipeline
- Add bundle size analysis tools
- Create automated alerts for budget violations
- Use Bun's built-in benchmarking features

**Testing Focus**:

- Performance regression tests
- Bundle size analysis
- Memory usage profiling
- Startup time measurements

### TECH-001: TypeScript Strict Mode Complexity

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Strict mode will cause friction for developers not familiar with strict TypeScript
**Impact**: Medium - May slow initial development velocity
**Mitigation**:

- Provide TypeScript strict mode training
- Create coding guidelines document
- Use automated fixes where possible
- Consider gradual strictness adoption

**Testing Focus**:

- Type coverage analysis
- Compilation performance tests
- Developer experience feedback

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- Performance benchmarking suite for startup, memory, and operations
- TypeScript compilation tests across all packages
- Dependency conflict detection tests

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Build system integration tests
- Pre-commit hook validation tests
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Cross-package dependency tests

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- VSCode configuration validation
- Documentation completeness checks

## Risk Mitigation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Story Completion)

1. **Performance Monitoring Setup**
   - Add performance benchmarking scripts
   - Implement bundle size tracking
   - Create performance dashboard

2. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Document strict mode patterns
   - Create eslint rules for common issues
   - Add type coverage reporting

3. **Build System Hardening**
   - Implement build caching
   - Add parallel build support
   - Create build performance metrics

### Follow-up Actions (Next Sprint)

1. Set up CI/CD pipeline with quality gates
2. Implement automated performance testing
3. Add security scanning to build process
4. Create developer onboarding documentation

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Build times per package
- Bundle sizes over time
- TypeScript compilation performance
- Developer experience metrics
- Security vulnerability reports

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Adding new packages to monorepo
- Upgrading Bun version
- Changing TypeScript configuration
- Modifying build process
- Adding new development tools

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- Performance budget enforcement mechanism
- Basic CI/CD pipeline setup

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- TypeScript strict mode friction (with documentation)
- Monorepo dependency management (with tooling)
- Pre-commit hook strictness (with bypass option)

### Accepted Risks

- Bun ecosystem maturity (monitor and adapt)
- Minor security audit gaps (enhance over time)

## Overall Risk Assessment

**Risk Score: 59/100** - Moderate risk level, primarily operational and performance concerns rather than critical security or data risks. The project setup is generally solid but needs additional tooling for performance enforcement and CI/CD automation.

## Recommendations

### Must Do

1. Implement automated performance budget checks
2. Set up basic CI/CD pipeline
3. Document TypeScript strict mode patterns

### Should Do

1. Add build caching and optimization
2. Enhance security scanning
3. Create comprehensive developer documentation

### Could Do

1. Implement advanced monitoring
2. Add visual regression testing
3. Create custom Bun plugins for optimization
