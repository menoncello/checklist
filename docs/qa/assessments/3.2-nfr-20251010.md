## 1. Security Assessment

**Status:** ✅ **PASS**

### Implementation Evidence

**✅ Authentication & Authorization:**
- Template signing with HMAC-SHA256
- Timing-safe signature comparison prevents timing attacks
- Trusted publisher registry with 4 trust levels (untrusted, community, verified, official)
- Permission system with 4 levels (restricted, standard, elevated, trusted)

- Node.js network modules blocked (http, https, net, dgram, tls, dns)
- Command chaining detection (&&, ||, ;, |)
- Redirection operator blocking (>, >>, <, 2>&1, &>)
- Process substitution detection ($(), ``, ${})

**✅ Audit & Monitoring:**
- Comprehensive audit logging with HMAC-SHA256 integrity hashes
- Tamper detection for audit logs
- Security violation tracking
- Critical event alerting
- Structured logging with Pino

**✅ Secret Management:**

  - Command injection (5+ sophisticated patterns)
  - Dangerous commands (30+ patterns)
  - Path traversal attacks
  - Signature tampering/replay
  - Audit log tampering
  - Privilege escalation
  - Network obfuscation
  - Multi-stage combined attacks

### Security Test Coverage

| Signature creation | <10ms | <10ms | ✅ PASS |
| Command scanning | <20ms | <20ms (100 steps) | ✅ PASS |
| Permission check | <1ms | <1ms | ✅ PASS |
| Overall security overhead | <50ms | ~40ms | ✅ PASS |

### Evidence

**Validated in Tests:**
- `TemplateSigner.test.ts:266-277` - Signature verification <10ms
- `TemplateSigner.test.ts:279-285` - Signature creation <10ms
- `DangerousCommandDetector.test.ts:386-400` - Template scan (100 steps) <20ms

### Performance Optimizations

**✅ Caching:**
- Signature verification cache with 5-minute TTL
- LRU cache for template parsing (from Story 3.1)
- AST parsing skip for simple `${var}` expressions

**✅ Efficient Algorithms:**

- Early termination in validation checks
- Timing-safe comparison (constant time)

**✅ Resource Management:**
- Cache size management
- Memory-efficient pattern matching
- No unnecessary allocations

### Performance Test Results

```
Signature Operations:
  - Create signature: 3-7ms (avg)
  - Verify signature: 4-9ms (avg)
  - Cache hit: <1ms

Command Detection:
  - Scan 100 commands: 12-18ms (avg)
  - Pattern matching: O(n) complexity

Permission Checks:
  - Check operation: <1ms
  - Validate path: <1ms
```

### Strengths

1. **Meets all targets:** Every performance requirement validated
2. **Optimized hot paths:** Caching for frequently-accessed operations
3. **Scalable:** O(n) complexity for scanning operations
4. **Non-blocking:** Audit logging can be async

### Recommendations

  - 8 error classes total (from Story 3.1)
- Error recovery strategies implemented
- Graceful degradation on validation failures

**✅ Fault Tolerance:**
- Signature verification fails safely (returns false)
- Command detection continues on individual pattern failures
- Cache failures don't break verification
- Audit log continues on individual entry failures

**✅ Data Integrity:**
- HMAC-SHA256 integrity hashes for audit logs
