#### AC4: File output configured using Pino file transport with separate files for different log levels

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Configuration**: `logger.ts::file transport setup`
  - Given: Transport configuration for different log levels
  - When: Logs are written
  - Then: Separated into /.logs/info/, /.logs/error/, /.logs/debug/ directories

**Gap Identified**: No integration tests verify file creation and separation by level

#### AC5: Support for 3rd party services via pino-transport plugins only (no custom implementations)

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Implementation**: `logger.ts::transport configuration`
  - Given: Pino-transport base package installed
  - When: External service integration needed
  - Then: Uses official Pino transport plugins only

**Gap Identified**: No tests verify transport plugin compatibility or error handling

#### AC6: Debug library completely replaced with injectable Pino logger service

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Code Review**: Multiple service files using createLogger
  - Given: All services and modules in codebase
  - When: Checking for debug library usage
  - Then: Only Pino logger imports found, no debug library references

- **Implementation Test**: `WorkflowEngine.ts`, `StateManager.ts`, etc.
  - Given: Services requiring logging
  - When: Logger needed
  - Then: Uses createLogger from '@checklist/core/utils/logger'

#### AC7: Logger service created with clear interface for testing (mockable)

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `logger.test.ts::MockLogger`
  - Given: Need for test double
  - When: Creating mock logger via TestDataFactory
  - Then: Full Logger interface implemented with tracking

- **Unit Test**: `logger.test.ts::LogAssertions`
  - Given: Mock logger with captured calls
  - When: Asserting on log behavior
  - Then: Can verify messages, levels, and context

#### AC8: All logging features must use Pino native capabilities or official Pino plugins only

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Code Review**: `logger.ts` implementation
  - Given: Logger service implementation
  - When: Reviewing all features
  - Then: Uses only Pino core and official plugins

**Gap Identified**: No explicit tests enforce this constraint

#### AC9: Logger must be fully mockable in all test scenarios with test doubles provided

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `logger.test.ts::MockLogger complete test suite`
  - Given: Test scenarios requiring logger mocks
  - When: Using TestDataFactory.createMockLogger()
  - Then: All logger methods mockable with call tracking

- **Test Utilities**: `MockLogger.ts`, `TestDataFactory.ts`, `LogAssertions.ts`
  - Given: Need for comprehensive test utilities
  - When: Running any test
  - Then: Full mock capabilities available

#### AC10: Performance: Logging overhead must not exceed 5ms per operation

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Performance Test**: `logger.test.ts::should meet performance requirements (<5ms)`
  - Given: Logger creation operation
  - When: Measuring execution time
  - Then: Duration is less than 5ms

- **Performance Test**: `logger.test.ts::should handle high-volume logging efficiently`
  - Given: 1000 log operations
  - When: Measuring average time per log
  - Then: Average duration well under 2ms per operation

#### AC11: All log entries include contextual metadata (timestamp, module, trace ID)

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `logger.test.ts::Child loggers`
  - Given: Logger with namespace and child context
  - When: Creating child loggers with additional context
  - Then: All context preserved and included

- **Implementation**: `logger.ts::createLogger with trace ID generation`
  - Given: Any logger instance
  - When: Logging messages
  - Then: Includes timestamp, module name, and trace ID automatically

### Critical Gaps

1. **File Transport Testing**
   - Gap: No integration tests for actual file writing
   - Risk: High - Core functionality not validated
   - Action: Create integration tests for file transport

2. **Log Rotation Verification**
   - Gap: No tests verify pino-roll rotation behavior
   - Risk: Medium - Rotation may fail in production
   - Action: Add rotation trigger tests

3. **Transport Plugin Testing**
   - Gap: No tests for 3rd party transport error handling
   - Risk: Medium - External service failures could crash app
   - Action: Mock transport failure scenarios

4. **Directory Creation**
   - Gap: No tests verify /.logs/ directory structure creation
   - Risk: Low - May fail on first run
   - Action: Add directory initialization tests

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Integration Test Suite** (`logger.integration.test.ts`)
   - File writing to correct directories
   - Log rotation trigger scenarios
   - Transport multiplexing verification
   - Directory creation and permissions

2. **Service Integration Tests**
   - BaseService logger injection
   - DIContainer logger registration
   - Child logger context propagation

3. **Error Scenario Tests**
   - File system write failures
   - Transport connection failures
   - Rotation failure recovery

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: File transport functionality (no integration tests)
- **Medium Risk**: Log rotation and transport plugins (partial coverage)
- **Low Risk**: Core logging API and performance (fully covered)

### Overall Assessment

The implementation shows strong unit test coverage for core functionality (45% full coverage), but lacks integration tests for file operations and transport features. The mockability and performance requirements are well-tested, but production-critical features like file rotation need validation.
