### Critical Gaps

1. **CI Integration (AC5)**
   - Gap: No tests for CI workflow integration
   - Risk: High - Performance regressions could go undetected in automated builds
   - Action: Implement CI integration tests including workflow execution and baseline comparison

2. **Debug Overlay Toggle (AC2)**
   - Gap: Missing test for Ctrl+Shift+D keyboard shortcut
   - Risk: Medium - Debug overlay toggle functionality not validated
   - Action: Add integration test for keyboard shortcut handling

3. **Export Formats (AC6)**
   - Gap: Missing tests for JSON/CSV export formats and file rotation
   - Risk: Medium - Export functionality not fully validated
   - Action: Add comprehensive export format tests

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Additional Test Scenarios Needed**:
   - CI workflow integration tests
   - Keyboard shortcut integration tests
   - Export format validation tests
   - File rotation mechanism tests

2. **Test Types to Implement**:
   - Integration tests for CI pipeline
   - End-to-end tests for complete export workflow
   - Performance tests for export overhead validation

3. **Test Data Requirements**:
   - Sample performance metrics datasets
   - Mock CI environment configuration
   - Various export format examples

4. **Mock/Stub Strategies**:
   - Mock CI pipeline services
   - Stub file system operations for export testing
   - Mock keyboard event handlers

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: AC5 (CI integration) - No coverage could miss performance regressions
- **Medium Risk**: AC2 (Debug overlay) and AC6 (Export formats) - Partial coverage may miss edge cases
- **Low Risk**: AC1, AC3, AC4, AC7, AC8 - Full coverage with multiple test levels

### Quality Indicators

✅ **Strengths**:
- Critical performance monitoring components have comprehensive test coverage
- Multiple test levels (unit, integration, performance) for core functionality
- Good separation of concerns in test organization
- Performance budget and alerting well tested

⚠️ **Areas for Improvement**:
- CI integration testing is completely missing
- Export functionality needs more comprehensive testing
- Some integration scenarios need additional coverage

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Implement CI integration tests for AC5
2. **Short-term**: Add keyboard shortcut and export format tests
3. **Long-term**: Consider adding load tests for performance validation
4. **Documentation**: Update test documentation to cover new scenarios
