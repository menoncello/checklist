## Risk Matrix

| Risk Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation |
|---------------|-------------|---------|-------|------------|
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | 3 | Performance tests validate requirements |
| Terminal compatibility | Low | Medium | 3 | Fallback renderer implemented |
| Error recovery failure | Low | High | 4 | Comprehensive error boundaries |
| State corruption | Low | High | 4 | State validation and recovery |
| Focus management | Medium | Low | 2 | Thorough focus testing |

## Risk Summary

**Overall Risk: LOW** (Average score: 3.2)

### Critical Risks (Score ≥ 6): None
### Significant Risks (Score ≥ 4): 2 items
### Minor Risks (Score < 4): 3 items

## Risk Details

### High Impact Risks

**Error Recovery Failure** (Score: 4)
- **Description**: Error boundaries may not handle all edge cases
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive error testing and recovery mechanisms implemented
- **Monitoring**: Error logging and recovery tracking in production

**State Corruption** (Score: 4)
- **Description**: Application state could become inconsistent during errors
- **Mitigation**: State validation and atomic updates implemented
- **Monitoring**: State consistency checks and backup mechanisms

### Medium Impact Risks

**Performance Degradation** (Score: 3)
- **Description**: Layout operations may exceed timing requirements
- **Mitigation**: Performance benchmarks and monitoring in place
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics collection

**Terminal Compatibility** (Score: 3)
- **Description**: Some terminals may not support all features
- **Mitigation**: Capability detection and fallback rendering implemented
- **Monitoring**: Terminal capability reporting

### Low Impact Risks

**Focus Management** (Score: 2)
- **Description**: Focus transitions may not work correctly in all scenarios
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive focus testing and event handling
- **Monitoring**: Focus state logging and user feedback

## Risk Mitigation Status

✅ **Complete**: Error recovery mechanisms fully implemented
✅ **Complete**: State corruption prevention measures in place
✅ **Complete**: Performance validation tests added
✅ **Complete**: Terminal fallback rendering implemented
✅ **Complete**: Focus management thoroughly tested

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor production performance** - Track actual startup and layout times
2. **User feedback collection** - Monitor focus management issues
3. **Error recovery enhancement** - Consider additional recovery scenarios
4. **Performance optimization** - Profile under real-world usage patterns

## Next Review

Risk reassessment recommended in 4 weeks or after production deployment.
