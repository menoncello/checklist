## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Secret Scanning**: Implement gitleaks and GitHub secret scanning on all workflows
- **Action Auditing**: Verify all third-party actions with SHA pinning
- **Token Permission Testing**: Validate minimal permission principle
- **Supply Chain Security**: Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Cross-Platform Build Validation**: Test binary compilation on all OS targets
- **Windows CI Reliability**: Specific Windows runner testing with timeouts
- **Usage Monitoring**: GitHub Actions minute consumption tracking
- **Stress Testing**: Pipeline performance under load

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Cache Effectiveness**: Validate cache hit rates
- **Coverage Persistence**: Test coverage trend tracking
- **Release Rollback**: Verify atomic release capabilities
- **Benchmark Stability**: Performance regression detection

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- SEC-001: NPM token security must be hardened
- SEC-002: All actions must be SHA-pinned and audited
- OPS-001: Windows build reliability must meet 95% success rate

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- TECH-001: Document platform-specific build requirements
- BUS-001: Monitor usage with alerts at 80% threshold
- PERF-001: Accept slower pipelines initially with optimization roadmap

### Accepted Risks
- BUS-002: Documentation updates can lag by one sprint
- TECH-003: Bun version can be updated quarterly

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Security Metrics**: Secret scanning alerts, vulnerability reports
- **Performance Metrics**: Pipeline execution times, cache hit rates
- **Operational Metrics**: Build success rates per platform, release success rate
- **Business KPIs**: GitHub Actions usage percentage, developer feedback scores

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Adding new third-party GitHub Actions
- Modifying secret management approach
- Changing build or release processes
- GitHub Actions pricing or limits change
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in dependencies
- Platform support requirements change

## Recommendations Summary

2. Pin all GitHub Actions to SHA hashes
3. Configure proper GITHUB_TOKEN permissions
4. Add Windows-specific CI optimizations

### Should Monitor
1. GitHub Actions usage against free tier limit
2. Cross-platform build success rates
