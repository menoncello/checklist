## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Cross-platform terminal behavior differences

- **Testing Focus**: Integration tests across Terminal.app, iTerm2, Alacritty, Windows Terminal

### 2. TECH-002: Visual regression testing reliability

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Screenshot comparison is inherently fragile
**Impact**: Medium - May cause false positives/negatives in testing

**Mitigation**:
- Implement robust image comparison with tolerance settings
- Create terminal-specific baseline images
- Use multiple comparison strategies (pixel, structural, functional)
- **Testing Focus**: Automated visual regression test suite with manual validation

### 3. PERF-001: Capability detection performance budget

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Complex detection logic could be slow
**Impact**: High - Could impact application startup time significantly

**Mitigation**:
- Implement aggressive caching with appropriate expiry
- Optimize detection algorithms for performance
- Use lazy loading for non-critical capabilities
- **Testing Focus**: Performance profiling and benchmarking of detection routines

## High Risk Tests Requiring Special Attention

### 4. OPS-001: Test environment consistency

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - CI environments may have different terminal capabilities
**Impact**: Medium - Inconsistent test results across environments

**Mitigation**:
- Standardize test environment configuration
- Implement environment capability normalization
- Create containerized testing environment
- **Testing Focus**: Cross-environment compatibility validation

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

1. **Cross-platform Terminal Compatibility Testing**
   - Test on Terminal.app, iTerm2, Alacritty, Windows Terminal
   - Validate ANSI sequence interpretation
   - Test rendering consistency across terminals

2. **Performance Budget Validation**
   - Measure capability detection timing
   - Profile memory usage during detection
   - Validate against <5ms overhead requirement

3. **Visual Regression Testing Framework**
   - Establish baseline images for each terminal
   - Implement robust comparison algorithms
   - Create automated visual test pipeline

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

1. **Test Environment Consistency**
   - Cross-CI platform testing
   - Environment capability normalization
   - Containerized test validation

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

### Performance Metrics
- Capability detection timing (<5ms target)
- Memory usage during detection (<50MB baseline)
- Startup time impact (<100ms total)

### Quality Metrics
- Visual regression test pass rate
- Cross-terminal compatibility issues
- User-reported terminal problems

### Business Metrics
- User satisfaction with terminal compatibility
- Support tickets related to terminal issues
- Adoption rate across different terminals

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New terminal emulators are added to support matrix
- Performance budgets are exceeded
- Visual regression tests show high failure rates
- User feedback indicates terminal compatibility issues
- Terminal capability detection algorithms are modified
- Significant changes to TUI framework architecture

## Risk-Based Recommendations

### Testing Priority

1. **Immediate**: Cross-platform compatibility testing

### Development Focus

1. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure detection meets <5ms budget
2. **Testing Infrastructure**: Invest in automated terminal testing
3. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive compatibility matrix
4. **User Experience**: Implement warning and recommendation system

### Deployment Strategy

1. **Phased Rollout**: Start with developer preview
2. **Feature Flags**: Enable compatibility detection gradually
3. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive performance and compatibility monitoring
4. **Rollback**: Plan for disabling problematic detection features

### Quality Gates

- **Critical**: All critical risks must be mitigated before production
- **Performance**: Capability detection must meet performance budgets
- **Testing**: Minimum 85% mutation coverage for terminal code
- **Documentation**: Compatibility matrix must be complete and accurate
