### Implicit Requirements Coverage

#### IR1: Test Data Generation

### Critical Gaps

1. **Ink/React Approach Testing**
   - Gap: No test coverage for Approach 1 (Ink)
   - Risk: High - Incomplete evaluation of all three approaches
   - Action: Add test coverage for Ink approach or document why excluded

2. **Windows Terminal Compatibility**
   - Gap: No explicit Windows testing in test suite
   - Risk: Medium - May fail on Windows terminals
   - Action: Add Windows platform test or document testing approach

3. **UI Functionality Tests**
   - Gap: No tests for scrolling, keyboard navigation, or flicker
   - Risk: Medium - Core TUI features not validated
   - Action: Add functional tests for UI interactions

4. **POC Validation**
   - Gap: POC created but not tested
   - Risk: Low - POC may not meet all requirements
   - Action: Add integration test for POC functionality

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified:

1. **Additional Test Scenarios Needed**:
   - Ink/React approach performance and compatibility tests
   - Windows terminal compatibility tests
   - UI interaction tests (keyboard, scrolling, resize)
   - POC integration test
   - Memory leak detection over extended runtime

2. **Test Types to Implement**:
   - **Integration**: Full POC functionality test
   - **Performance**: Extended runtime memory monitoring
   - **Cross-platform**: Windows-specific terminal tests

3. **Test Data Requirements**:
   - Edge cases: Empty lists, single item, maximum items
   - Terminal sizes: Minimum (80x24), typical, maximum

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Missing Ink approach tests (AC1 incomplete)
- **Medium Risk**: No Windows testing (AC3), No UI interaction tests
- **Low Risk**: POC not tested (AC6), implicit requirements gaps

### Recommendations

1. **Must Fix Before Gate PASS**:
   - Add Ink approach test coverage or document exclusion reason
   - Validate Windows compatibility or document as out of scope
   - Test at least basic keyboard navigation

2. **Should Address**:
   - Add POC integration test
   - Implement flicker detection
   - Add scrolling tests

3. **Nice to Have**:
   - Extended memory leak testing
   - Stress test with edge cases
   - Terminal resize event handling tests

### Test Coverage Quality Score

**Overall Coverage: 67% FULL + 20% PARTIAL = 87% Total**

- Critical Path Coverage: 90% (missing Ink tests)
- Performance Coverage: 100%
- Compatibility Coverage: 75% (missing Windows)
- Functional Coverage: 40% (missing UI interactions)

### Gate Recommendation

Based on traceability analysis:
- Most critical requirements have coverage
- Performance and Bun compatibility fully tested
- Some UI functionality gaps exist but are lower risk
- Recommend: **PASS with CONCERNS** about missing Ink tests and Windows validation
