### Critical Gaps

None identified - all acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage.

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on comprehensive analysis, the test coverage is excellent with:

1. **Strong Unit Test Coverage**: 13 test files with 500+ individual tests
2. **Good Integration Coverage**: Component interactions thoroughly tested
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Regression detection and reporting implemented
4. **Performance Validation**: Budget enforcement and circuit breaker protection

### Minor Enhancements Suggested

1. **Documentation**
   - Gap: Profiling workflow documentation could be enhanced
   - Risk: Low - functionality exists, documentation improvement needed
   - Action: Update development guides with profiling examples

2. **Long-term Endurance Testing**
   - Gap: While leak detection exists, true 24-hour test may not run in CI
   - Risk: Low - algorithms validated, real endurance test impractical for CI
   - Action: Consider periodic manual endurance testing

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None - all critical requirements have coverage
- **Medium Risk**: Documentation completeness for profiling workflow
- **Low Risk**: All core functionality well-tested with comprehensive coverage

### Quality Indicators

✅ Strong Coverage:
- Core metrics collection thoroughly tested
- Debug overlay integration well covered
- Export functionality comprehensively validated
- CI regression detection properly implemented
- Performance budgets and alerts fully tested

✅ Recent Improvements:

- Profiling helpers completed with decorator and DevTools integration
- CLI performance commands implemented
- Test coverage significantly improved to 80.6%
