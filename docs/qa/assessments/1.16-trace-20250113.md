# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Story: 1.16 - Code Quality Metrics Enforcement

### Coverage Summary

- Total Requirements: 9 (ACs)
- Fully Covered: 5 (56%)
- Partially Covered: 3 (33%)
- Not Covered: 1 (11%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: File size limits enforced (max 300 lines per file, excluding comments and blank lines)

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Configuration Test**: `build-system.test.ts::Build Scripts`
  - Given: ESLint configuration with max-lines rule set to 300
  - When: Linting process runs on files exceeding threshold
  - Then: ESLint reports violations for files over 300 lines

- **CI/CD Integration**: `.github/workflows/main.yml::Run Linting`
  - Given: Pipeline executing on code changes
  - When: Files exceed 300-line limit
  - Then: CI build fails with ESLint violations

- **Pre-commit Hook**: `.husky/pre-commit::lint-staged`
  - Given: Developer attempting to commit files
  - When: Staged files exceed line limits
  - Then: Commit is blocked until violations are fixed

#### AC2: Method/function size limits enforced (max 30 lines per function)

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Configuration Test**: ESLint `max-lines-per-function` rule
  - Given: Functions exceeding 30 lines in codebase
  - When: ESLint analysis runs
  - Then: Violations reported for oversized functions

- **Quality Script Test**: `package.json::lint script`
  - Given: Developer runs `bun run quality`
  - When: Function size limits are violated
  - Then: Quality check fails with specific violations

#### AC3: Cyclomatic complexity limits enforced (max complexity of 10)

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Configuration Test**: ESLint `complexity` rule
  - Given: Code with high cyclomatic complexity
  - When: Complexity analysis runs
  - Then: Functions exceeding complexity 10 are flagged

- **Validation Test**: Developer workflow validation
  - Given: Developer writes complex conditional logic
  - When: Pre-commit hook executes
  - Then: Commit blocked if complexity > 10

#### AC4: Maximum indentation depth enforced (max 3 levels)

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Configuration Test**: ESLint `max-depth` rule
  - Given: Deeply nested code structures
  - When: Depth analysis runs
  - Then: Code exceeding 3 levels of nesting is flagged

- **Integration Test**: Refactoring validation
  - Given: Refactored code maintaining depth limits
  - When: Quality checks run
  - Then: No depth violations reported

#### AC5: Quality metrics integrated into existing ESLint configuration

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Configuration Test**: `eslint.config.js` verification
  - Given: ESLint configuration file
  - When: Quality rules are examined
  - Then: All metric rules present and properly configured

- **Integration Test**: Existing workflow compatibility
  - Given: Pre-existing ESLint setup
  - When: New rules are added
  - Then: All existing functionality continues to work

#### AC6: CI/CD pipeline fails when quality thresholds are exceeded

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Pipeline Test**: `.github/workflows/main.yml` validation
  - Given: GitHub Actions workflow configuration
  - When: Lint step executes with violations
  - Then: Pipeline fails and blocks merge
  - **Gap**: No automated test validates actual pipeline failure behavior

- **Manual Validation**: Developer testing
  - Given: Test file with intentional violations
  - When: CI pipeline processes the changes
  - Then: Build fails as expected
  - **Gap**: Only manually verified, no automated CI failure tests

#### AC7: Detailed quality reports generated for each violation in reports/quality/

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Report Generation**: `package.json::lint:report` script
  - Given: ESLint violations in codebase
  - When: `bun run lint:report` executes
  - Then: HTML report created at `reports/quality/eslint-report.html`

- **CI Integration**: Workflow artifact upload
  - Given: Quality report generated in CI
  - When: CI job completes
  - Then: Report uploaded as GitHub artifact
  - **Gap**: No validation of report content quality or completeness

#### AC8: Existing code refactored to meet new quality standards

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Core Package**: Refactoring validation
  - Given: Large files in core package
  - When: Refactoring is applied
  - Then: File sizes reduced below 300 lines
  - **Evidence**: ServiceBindings.ts refactored from 346 to 15 lines

- **Test Coverage**: Post-refactoring validation
  - Given: Refactored core package code
  - When: Test suite runs
  - Then: All tests continue to pass (796 tests, 765 pass, 31 skip)
  - **Gap**: TUI, CLI, and Shared packages not yet refactored

#### AC9: Pre-commit hooks validate quality metrics locally

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Hook Configuration**: `.husky/pre-commit` validation
  - Given: Developer attempting to commit changes
  - When: Pre-commit hook executes lint-staged
  - Then: Quality violations prevent commit

- **Local Validation**: Hook execution test
  - Given: Files with quality violations staged
  - When: `git commit` command runs
  - Then: Commit blocked with specific error messages

### Critical Gaps

1. **CI Pipeline Failure Testing**
   - Gap: No automated validation that CI actually fails on quality violations
   - Risk: Medium - Could allow violations to pass if pipeline misconfigured
   - Action: Add integration test to validate CI failure behavior

2. **Report Content Validation**
   - Gap: No verification of report completeness or accuracy
   - Risk: Low - Reports generated but content not validated
   - Action: Add tests to validate report structure and violation details

3. **Incomplete Refactoring Coverage**
   - Gap: Only 1 of 4 packages fully refactored to meet standards
   - Risk: High - 40+ files still violate quality metrics
   - Action: Complete TUI, CLI, and Shared package refactoring

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **CI Integration Tests**
   - Create test that intentionally violates quality rules
   - Validate that CI pipeline actually fails
   - Test artifact upload functionality

2. **Report Validation Tests**
   - Parse generated HTML reports
   - Validate violation counts and details
   - Ensure report accessibility and completeness

3. **Refactoring Progress Tests**
   - Automated validation that all packages meet quality standards
   - Regression tests for refactored components
   - Performance impact validation post-refactoring

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Incomplete refactoring (AC8) - 40+ files still exceed limits
- **Medium Risk**: Untested CI failure behavior (AC6) - Pipeline might allow violations
- **Low Risk**: All configuration and tooling properly implemented and tested

### Current Test Coverage Analysis

**Existing Quality-Related Tests:**
- `build-system.test.ts` - Validates build scripts and quality scripts exist
- `.husky/pre-commit` - Enforces quality checks before commits
- `.github/workflows/main.yml` - Runs quality checks in CI
- `package.json` scripts - Provides quality enforcement commands

**Test Types Present:**
- Unit tests: ESLint configuration validation
- Integration tests: Build system and quality script validation
- System tests: CI/CD pipeline quality gates
- Manual tests: Developer workflow validation

**Test Coverage by Package:**
- Core: 765 passing tests (31 skipped) - Strong coverage
- TUI: Multiple component and performance tests
- CLI: Command and integration tests
- Shared: Utility and validation tests

### Implementation Status

**Completed (✅):**
- ESLint quality rules configuration
- HTML report generation setup
- CI/CD quality integration
- Pre-commit hook quality validation
- Core package partial refactoring
- Quality script integration
- Baseline quality analysis

**In Progress (⚠️):**
- Core package full refactoring
- TUI package refactoring
- CLI package refactoring
- Shared package refactoring

**Gaps (❌):**
- Automated CI failure validation
- Report content validation tests
- Complete refactoring of all packages

### Quality Gate Recommendation

Based on this traceability analysis:
- **5/9 ACs fully covered (56%)**
- **3/9 ACs partially covered (33%)**
- **1/9 ACs not covered (11%)**
- **Critical infrastructure implemented**
- **Major refactoring work remaining**

**Recommended Gate Status: CONCERNS**

Rationale: Core quality enforcement infrastructure is solid with good test coverage, but significant refactoring work remains incomplete across 3 of 4 packages.
