### Critical Gaps

1. **State Migration Execution (AC14)**
   - Gap: Migration utilities only check compatibility, no actual migration logic tested
   - Risk: Medium - Schema changes could break existing states
   - Action: Implement and test actual migration transformations

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Gap: Tests run on current platform only (as noted in Definition of Done)
   - Risk: High - File system behavior varies across OS
   - Action: Set up CI/CD matrix testing for Windows/macOS/Linux

### Non-Functional Requirements Coverage

#### Performance Requirements

- **Coverage: FULL**
- State initialization: Tested < 1000ms threshold
- State load/save: Tested < 50ms threshold
- Lock acquisition: Tested < 100ms threshold
- All operations tested to complete < 10ms (excluding I/O)

#### Concurrency Requirements

- **Coverage: FULL**
- 100+ concurrent operations tested
- Exclusive lock acquisition verified
- Timeout and retry mechanisms tested
- Stale lock cleanup tested (though one test skipped due to timing issues)

#### Security Requirements

- **Coverage: PARTIAL**
- File permissions tested (0755 for dirs, 0644 for files)
- Gap: No explicit testing for sensitive data handling in state files

### Test Coverage Statistics

**Test File Distribution:**

- `DirectoryManager.test.ts`: 7 tests - Directory operations
- `validation.test.ts`: 17 tests - Schema and checksum validation
- `ConcurrencyManager.test.ts`: 16 tests - Locking mechanisms
- `TransactionCoordinator.test.ts`: 16 tests - Transaction management
- `BackupManager.test.ts`: 22 tests - Backup and recovery
- `manager.test.ts`: 14 tests - State management operations

**Total: 92 test cases** (86 passing, 1 skipped, 5 in manager.test.ts not fully implemented)

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified:

1. **Add Migration Tests**
   - Test schema v1.0.0 to v2.0.0 migration
   - Test backward compatibility
   - Test data preservation during migration

2. **Cross-Platform Tests**
   - Windows file locking behavior
   - macOS extended attributes
   - Linux file permissions

3. **Security Tests**
   - Secrets detection before persistence
   - Encryption of sensitive fields
   - Access control validation

4. **Performance Under Load**
   - Stress test with large state files (>10MB)
   - Concurrent transaction stress testing
   - Memory usage monitoring

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Cross-platform compatibility untested
- **Medium Risk**: Migration execution not implemented
- **Medium Risk**: Security controls partially tested
- **Low Risk**: Core functionality well covered

### Conclusion

Story 1.0 has strong test coverage (86.7% of ACs fully covered) with comprehensive unit and integration tests. The main gaps are in cross-platform testing and complete migration implementation. The 86 passing tests provide confidence in the core state management functionality, though production readiness requires addressing the identified gaps.
