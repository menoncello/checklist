# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Story: 1.12 - StrykerJS Mutation Testing Infrastructure

### Coverage Summary

- Total Requirements: 8
- Fully Covered: 6 (75%)
- Partially Covered: 2 (25%)
- Not Covered: 0 (0%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: StrykerJS configured with command runner to execute Bun tests directly

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Configuration File**: `stryker.conf.js`
  - Given: StrykerJS installation with @stryker-mutator/core@9.1.x
  - When: Configuration uses testRunner: 'command' with commandRunner
  - Then: Bun tests execute via 'bun test --bail --coverage' command

- **Validation Test**: Documented validation in Dev Agent Record
  - Given: Test project with minimal Bun test setup
  - When: Running bunx stryker run
  - Then: Achieved 62.32% mutation score on validation.ts

#### AC2: Mutation score threshold set to 85% minimum

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Configuration**: `stryker.conf.js::thresholds`
  - Given: Threshold configuration object
  - When: Setting break: 85, low: 90, high: 95
  - Then: CI fails if score < 85%

- **CI Enforcement**: `.github/workflows/mutation.yml::Check Mutation Score Threshold`
  - Given: Mutation report JSON with score
  - When: Score is below 85%
  - Then: Exit code 1 triggers CI failure

#### AC3: StrykerJS integrated into CI/CD pipeline with failure on threshold breach

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **CI Workflow**: `.github/workflows/mutation.yml`
  - Given: GitHub Actions workflow triggered on push/PR
  - When: Mutation testing runs
  - Then: Full testing on main, incremental on PRs

- **Threshold Check**: `.github/workflows/mutation.yml::line 144-160`
  - Given: Main branch push with mutation report
  - When: Score < 85%
  - Then: Workflow fails with exit code 1

**Gap**: Dashboard integration requires STRYKER_DASHBOARD_API_TOKEN secret (Task 6 incomplete)

#### AC4: All default mutators enabled for comprehensive mutation coverage

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Configuration**: `stryker.conf.js`
  - Given: No mutator exclusions in config
  - When: StrykerJS runs
  - Then: All default mutators applied (String, Boolean, Conditional, Logical, Arithmetic, Array)

- **Documentation**: `docs/development/mutation-testing.md::Common Mutation Types`
  - Given: List of mutation types
  - When: Documented
  - Then: All default types confirmed active

#### AC5: HTML reporter configured for visual mutation reports

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Reporter Config**: `stryker.conf.js::htmlReporter`
  - Given: HTML reporter in reporters array
  - When: Mutation tests run
  - Then: Report generated at reports/mutation/index.html

- **CI Artifacts**: `.github/workflows/mutation.yml::Upload Mutation Report`
  - Given: Completed mutation test run
  - When: Workflow uploads artifacts
  - Then: HTML report available in GitHub Actions

#### AC6: Incremental testing enabled for faster PR validation

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Configuration**: `stryker.conf.js::incremental`
  - Given: incremental: true and incrementalFile settings
  - When: Running with --incremental flag
  - Then: Uses .stryker-tmp/incremental.json cache

- **PR Workflow**: `.github/workflows/mutation.yml::line 50-57`
  - Given: Pull request trigger
  - When: Mutation testing runs
  - Then: Uses --incremental flag for faster execution

#### AC7: Dashboard integration for tracking mutation score trends

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Configuration**: `stryker.conf.js::dashboard`
  - Given: Dashboard configuration with project details
  - When: STRYKER_DASHBOARD_API_TOKEN available
  - Then: Reports uploaded to dashboard.stryker-mutator.io

**Gap**: Dashboard token not configured (Task 6 subtasks pending):
- Registration on dashboard.stryker-mutator.io not completed
- STRYKER_DASHBOARD_API_TOKEN secret not stored
- Dashboard webhooks for notifications not setup

#### AC8: Parallel execution configured for optimal performance

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Configuration**: `stryker.conf.js::concurrency`
  - Given: concurrency: 4 setting
  - When: Mutation tests run
  - Then: Executes with 4 parallel threads

- **Performance Settings**: `stryker.conf.js`
  - Given: Performance optimizations
  - When: Configured with timeoutMS: 60000, coverageAnalysis: 'perTest'
  - Then: Optimized for CI environment

### Critical Gaps

1. **Dashboard Integration (AC7)**
   - Gap: Dashboard API token not configured
   - Risk: Medium - Cannot track mutation score trends
   - Action: Complete Task 6 subtasks for dashboard setup

2. **Test Coverage Improvements (Task 4)**
   - Gap: Subtasks for improving module test coverage incomplete
   - Risk: Medium - May not achieve 85% threshold consistently
   - Action: Strengthen test assertions per module targets

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Complete Dashboard Setup**
   - Register project on dashboard
   - Store API token as GitHub secret
   - Test dashboard reporting in CI

2. **Module Test Improvements**
   - Core Module: Target 90% mutation score
   - State Management: Target 85% mutation score
   - CLI Module: Target 85% mutation score
   - Workflow Engine: Target 95% mutation score

3. **CI/CD Enhancements**
   - Verify threshold enforcement works correctly
   - Test incremental mode caching
   - Validate PR comment functionality

### Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Core configuration and reporters (AC1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8) fully covered
- **Medium Risk**: Dashboard integration incomplete (AC7)
- **Medium Risk**: Some CI integration features untested (AC3 partial)

### Test Environment Considerations

Special handling implemented for mutation testing environment:
- STRYKER_MUTATOR_RUNNER environment variable detection
- Tests skip problematic scenarios when running in mutation sandbox
- Documented in affected test files (setup-validation.test.ts, performance-budget.test.ts)

### Validation Evidence

From Dev Agent Record:
- StrykerJS 9.1.0 successfully installed and configured
- Mutation testing validated with 62.32% score on validation.ts
- CI/CD workflow created and functional
- HTML and JSON reporters generating correctly
- Incremental mode operational with cache management
