Story: 2.5 - TUI Application Shell

## Executive Summary

- **Total Risks Identified**: 12 risks across 6 categories
- **Critical Risks**: 0 (score 9)
- **High Risks**: 2 (score 6)
- **Medium Risks**: 6 (score 4)
- **Low Risks**: 4 (score 2-3)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 42/100 (Moderate risk profile)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

None identified - No risks scored 9 (critical level).

## High Risks (Score 6)

### TECH-001: Complex terminal state management
- **Probability**: Medium (2) - Terminal complexity across different systems
- **Impact**: High (3) - Could leave terminal in unusable state
- **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive terminal capability detection with fallback modes
- **Testing Focus**: Terminal mode switching, error injection, state recovery

### TECH-002: Event loop blocking during layout operations
- **Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex layout calculations
- **Impact**: High (3) - UI freezes and poor user experience
- **Mitigation**: Implement asynchronous layout operations with batching
- **Testing Focus**: Performance benchmarks, load testing, memory profiling

## Risk Distribution by Category

- **Technical**: 3 risks (2 high, 1 medium)
- **Performance**: 3 risks (all medium)
- **Security**: 2 risks (1 low, 1 medium-low)
- **Data**: 2 risks (1 medium, 1 low)
- **Operational**: 2 risks (both low)

## Key Risk Drivers

1. **Terminal Management Complexity**: High complexity in handling terminal state across different environments
2. **Performance Requirements**: Strict timing constraints (<100ms startup, <50ms layout) create implementation pressure
3. **Integration Complexity**: Coordinating multiple existing subsystems increases failure surface area
4. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and lifecycle management critical for stability

## Risk-Based Testing Recommendations

### Priority 1 Testing (High Risk Focus)
- Terminal state management with error scenarios
- Layout performance under various load conditions
- Event loop monitoring during intensive operations
- Integration testing across all subsystems

### Priority 2 Testing (Medium Risk Focus)
- Startup time performance regression testing
- Memory leak detection in long-running instances
- Component integration contract testing
- Error recovery and graceful degradation scenarios

### Priority 3 Testing (Low Risk Focus)
- Standard functional testing of all components
- Documentation verification for operational procedures
- Security scanning for input validation gaps
- User acceptance testing for focus management

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- TECH-001 and TECH-002 must have comprehensive mitigation
- Performance benchmarks must pass (<100ms startup, <50ms layout)
- Terminal state management must have robust error handling

### Can Deploy with Monitoring
- Medium risks with appropriate monitoring in place
- Documented operational procedures
- Performance and error monitoring configured

## Risk Monitoring Recommendations

### Production Monitoring
- Application startup time metrics
- Layout operation performance metrics
- Terminal state change success/failure rates
- Memory usage trends for leak detection
- Error boundary trigger rates and types

### Development Monitoring
- Performance regression testing in CI/CD
- Integration test coverage for all subsystem interactions
- Code coverage metrics for new components (>85% target)
- Static analysis for security and performance issues

## Conclusion

Story 2.5 presents a **moderate risk profile** with significant technical challenges in terminal management and performance optimization. The absence of critical risks is positive, but the two high-risk items require focused attention during implementation.

The comprehensive testing strategy and mitigation approaches outlined should effectively manage the identified risks. Success will depend on thorough testing of terminal management, performance optimization, and integration points.

**Recommended Gate Decision**: CONCERNS (due to high-risk items requiring mitigation)
